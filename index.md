<p class="lede"><span class="highlight">Hullo, I'm Chris. I make digital services better and create beautiful illustrations.</span> </p>

As a digital professional, I have over 15 years of experience, specialising in user-centred design and strategic leadership for the UK Government, Capita and Sheffield City Council.

My work helps organisations develop, sustain and scale teams in order to build amazing products and services that customers and users want to use. 

I'm also an artist and illustrator. You can see examples of my work on my <a href="/art/">porfolio</a>. I've recently published part one of my debut comic <a href="https://bigstompyrobot.com/">Red Night</a>.

I maintain a few handy resources for designers in government over on <a href="https://github.com/ctdesign">Github</a>.

When not working, I like to watch movies, run (very slowly) and doodle.
