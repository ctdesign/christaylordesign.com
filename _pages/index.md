<p class="lede"><span class="highlight">Hullo, I'm Chris. I make digital services better and create beautiful illustrations.</span> </p>

As a digital professional, I have over 15 years of experience, specialising in user-centred design and strategic leadership for the UK Government, Capita and Sheffield City Council.

My work helps organisations develop, sustain and scale teams in order to build amazing products and services that customers and users want to use. 

I'm also an illustrator, specialising in editorial and portrait work. You can see examples of my work on my <a href="https://christaylor.tumblr.com">porfolio site</a>. 

When not working, I like to watch movies, run (very slowly) and work on my first comic book, <a href="https://bigstompyrobot.com/">Red Night</a>. 

I also maintain a few resources for gov designers on <a href="https://github.com/ctdesign">Github</a>.
