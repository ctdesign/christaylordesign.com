I'm writing this shortly after guzzling large amounts of freshly baked
cinnamon swirls for breakfast, with the delicious sweet pastry smell
still lingering in the air. Mmmm.

This of course triggers some guilt and my rational self has earnest
plans to go for a run to offset the sugar. But the pleasure of my second
cup of tea of the morning is anchoring [my
elephant](https://www.creativehuddle.co.uk/the-elephant-and-the-rider){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.creativehuddle.co.uk/the-elephant-and-the-rider"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and causing me to procrastinate. So, I'm
compromising with myself whilst I'm sat here by doing something
productive and finishing my weeknotes instead. I'll run later. Possibly.

Much of my working week has been spent traversing the country to London
and Croydon with an additional research trip to Durham. All of my team
and work is mostly in London now, although Sheffield is still
technically my office base. I usually have a weekly meet-up there with
friends for lunch but it's becoming increasingly difficult to schedule
regular catchups. I miss seeing them regularly although I am really
enjoying my work. I need to try and plan ahead more.

This week I had tickets to the International Gov Design conference which
I was really looking forward to. Unfortunately it clashed with an
important research trip but it was easy to find someone else interested
in going, so I passed on my ticket to a very grateful colleague. She
repaid me later on in the week with a Curly-Wurly, which I've not had in
years (yes, they really are smaller).

### Things that happened this week {#45ed .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="45ed"}

#### Researching with Durham Police {#3d76 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 name="3d76"}

One of the projects I'm on is learning more about how the Police
investigate certain types of crime. As part of the discovery we're
visiting a range of Police Forces across the UK .

This week I was able to accompany a colleague to visit a Police station
in Durham to learn more about their Digital Investigation and
Intelligence Unit.

They were incredibly accommodating and eager to help in any way they
can. It was amazing to learn more about the specialised unit and some of
the challenges they have. We managed to speak to four staff in a range
of different roles.

I was excited about all the insights we gained but felt pretty knackard
afterwards and I didn't get back till late.

#### Did some actual design work {#915b .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="915b"}

It was fun to get into some actual design work this week --- meaning
sketching and developing some html prototypes. I'm helping out a team
that's building a replacement for legacy Police systems.

I spent a day in Croydon with the team to learn more about what they
needed and do a bit of planning with them. I think there'll also be the
opportunity to reuse a lot of the learnings from different Home Office
delivery teams as it has similar functionality and user needs.

#### Lots of recruitment prep and admin {#9722 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="9722"}

We're setting up some permanent recruitment for one of our Policing
programmes which should hopefully mean lots of new design, research and
development roles coming up soon (watch this space or give me a shout if
you want to learn more).

Of course this naturally means much tedious but neccessary admim to book
rooms, fill out forms write job descriptions and plan timings.

I'm also helping out recruiting some contract designers for the National
Law Enforcement Data Service, a replacement for PND and PNC --- if
you're interested keep an eye out on the Digital Marketplace soon if
you're interested.

#### Caseworking guilt {#e590 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="e590"}

I've really been struggling to dedicate any time to progressing my
previous work on developing a caseworking community within gov. People
have asked me quite a few times when the next event is which is causing
me a bit of anxiousness --- however, I'll soon be roping in the help of
the Design Ops team within Home Office to help move this on.

Since the last meetup in March there's been a few things in the works to
help colleagues built better caseworking systems; we've been working on
a prototype template with some of the caseworking patterns we've
previously identified and a few of our teams in the Home Office are
collaborating on some development work that we will open sourcing for
other teams to build on.

</figure>

I still want to be involved in this but it needs someone who can
dedicate more time to it for now.

I'll soon publish some of the write ups of the two previous events here
to make them a bit easier to find.

If you're interested in helping out --- please let me know.

#### Other thoughts {#5967 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="5967"}

The general good natured and positive vibes emanating from twitter from
OneTeamGov and the International Gov Design Conference, oddly, made me
think about how we may be unintentionally causing harm.

Don't get me wrong, I think these kinds of events are great things to do
and everyone seems to come away from them incredibly positive and
motivated.

But I've been wondering for a while if we might be giving a slightly
unrealistic expectation of what working in government is like,
especially to those people we're trying to attract into working here.

You would be forgiven for thinking from reading the service manual and
the stream of blog posts about our collective successes that we're
making a steady but sure progress towards a fully digital government.

But my own personal experience is much more mixed than that and I don't
think I'm alone.

I remember not long after I worked here being surprised that colleagues
weren't aware of the service manual, or understood the principles of
lean, agile working. I'd meet senior managers who commissioned work to
replace legacy systems to save money but didn't even consider using it
as a way to rethink the service. Software is more of a depreciating
asset to them.

Now, a lot of these assumptions were down to my own naivety and I've
learned a lot since then, but I think I was persuaded to that thinking
by a lot of the blog posts and rhetoric that I was reading. I feel that
we need to be careful about positioning ourselves as working in this
digital utopian ideal where everyone gets design and
research --- because the reality is that we're far from it.

Putting on a good front is important and not dishonest or anything, but
I think we should talk more about some of the realities that we live in,
namely:

-   [lots of projects are commissioned without consideration of whether
    they're the right thing. Unfortunately, the point where a digital
    team gets involved if often too late to effect meaningful
    change.]{#354a}
-   [we have to advocate a lot for our profession and its value. I don't
    think this is necessarily a bad thing. When people like Alan Cooper
    complain about it's not design's job to show ROI I can't help but
    think that our industry's collective failure to show how effective
    we are means that we're not taken as seriously.]{#c992}
-   [how we do design and research is constantly misunderstood and
    misrepresented. People still equate Interaction Design with
    UI/visual design and think research is more about asking people what
    they like.]{#5aee}
-   [truely agile projects are not as common as they should be. The
    agile and design thinking mindset also needs to be extended more
    into senior civil service management, but it's unrealistic to ever
    think that we'll ever get to a top down agile mindset in
    government.]{#0782}

Don't get me wrong, I'm optimistic about things and there is lots of
great work going on that should be celebrated.

But I'd hate to think that some of the smart, amazing people that we're
attracting to Gov think that *they're* doing something wrong, when it's
the environment that can be hostile.

I think things like [weeknotes](http://weeknot.es/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://weeknot.es/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} and [Charles
Reynolds-Talbot](https://medium.com/u/4b4ad65327b9){.markup--user
.markup--p-user data-href="https://medium.com/u/4b4ad65327b9"
anchor-type="2" user-id="4b4ad65327b9" action-value="4b4ad65327b9"
data-action="show-user-card" action-type="hover" target="_blank"}'s [Gov
Design
publication](https://medium.com/gov-design/latest){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://medium.com/gov-design/latest"
target="_blank"} are a step in the right direction, by helping
facilitate some of the reality of people's experiences.

I'm going to try to be a bit more honest. I think it will be good for
us.

#### Other stuff {#dec1 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="dec1"}

I'm re-watching Battlestar Galactica which I'm appreciating more this
time around. I miss big serious sci-fi stuff on telly. I need to start
watching T*he Expanse* after this.

I only bought one thing in the Amazon Prime sale, which was some
wireless earphones to replace the ones I accidentally washed last
weekend. So quite serendipitous, plus they were £30 off.

I started reading *Switch: How to change things when change is hard*.

<figure id="48a4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img

class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*gHd_GlKsRYsCbpMM.jpg"
data-width="325" data-height="500" />
</figure>

I'm glad I started reading this after *The Righteous Mind* as it builds
on a lot of the concepts from that book. It helps me build a framework
around some of the persuading I need to do as part of my work to help
user-centred design get a better footing within Policing in the Home
Office.

I saw *Jumani: Welcome to the Jungle* last night, which was a lot of
fun. Me and my wife really wanted to go and see Ant-Man and the Wasp
this weekend but it's not out yet. I swore I've already seen a bunch of
promotion and reviews for it and assumed it had already been out for a
couple of weeks. There's too many interesting movies out at the moment
and they don't seem to be out very long before the next blockbuster
takes up all of the available screens. I've still not seen Deadpool 2,
Oceans 8 or Incredibles 2 yet and will probably have to wait till the
DVD's now. As a massive film fan this frustrates me somewhat.

I bookmarked some really interesting sounding articles which I've only
skimmed so far but would recommend:
