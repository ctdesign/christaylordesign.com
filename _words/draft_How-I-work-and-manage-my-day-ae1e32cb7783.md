### How I work and manage my day {#622b .graf .graf--h3 .graf--leading .graf--title name="622b"}

A rather long and detailed look into the processes and systems that I
use. 

There's a crapload of articles and books written on productivity and
time-magement --- a decent amount of which I'm read (or skimmed, let's
be honest). 

But I rarely see quite enough detail in order to see how to apply that
thinking to my particular context. 

My context is --- I have a relativly large amount of autonomy to
organise my day, I have a number of responsibilities and urgent actions
that come out of the blue, I have a number of irregular but predicable
short term activities (like recruitment, or procurement activities).
