Short and sweet one this week as I was only in work for 3 days (I'm
taking another long weekend off for my nephews wedding which I was very
excited about).

### Stuff that happened this week {#c946 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="c946"}

#### **Moar designers** {#42b0 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 name="42b0"}

My week started off well by welcoming the quietly spoken, incredibly
talented and coiffured [Eliot
Hill](https://medium.com/u/562e15f38882){.markup--user .markup--p-user
data-href="https://medium.com/u/562e15f38882" anchor-type="2"
user-id="562e15f38882" action-value="562e15f38882"
data-action="show-user-card" action-type="hover" target="_blank"} to our
Police Digital team. I spent a good chunk of the day going through
induction stuff with him and answering questions that I failed to
address in the induction materials.

Our central teams' Graphic Designer [Sue
Spevack](https://medium.com/u/ccd20cb2bccc){.markup--user
.markup--p-user data-href="https://medium.com/u/ccd20cb2bccc"
anchor-type="2" user-id="ccd20cb2bccc" action-value="ccd20cb2bccc"
data-action="show-user-card" action-type="hover" target="_blank"} also
joined us for the day to see what we're up to, so I gave them both the
tour. We've had lots of colleagues in other Home Office teams interested
in what we're doing so it's great to show people first hand.

#### **Moar hypotheses development** {#7b75 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="7b75"}

We spent a day continuing to figuring out what ideas we want to test for
our decision making project.

Throughout the end of this discovery/beginning of alpha phase we have
refined our initial higher level hypothesis and developed more specific
ones that we think we can test quickly in the alpha phase. [Alex
Gadsby](https://medium.com/u/642c18cbfe8a){.markup--user .markup--p-user
data-href="https://medium.com/u/642c18cbfe8a" anchor-type="2"
user-id="642c18cbfe8a" action-value="642c18cbfe8a"
data-action="show-user-card" action-type="hover" target="_blank"} has
done really stellar work in developing this.

#### **Moar prototyping** {#7124 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="7124"}

I spent all of Thursday with one of the Police teams in Croydon working
on revisions to a prototype, following some good feedback from the team
there. I also had the chance to have an in-depth chat with [Sam
Wakeling](https://medium.com/u/afd3f1f4ea9){.markup--user
.markup--p-user data-href="https://medium.com/u/afd3f1f4ea9"
anchor-type="2" user-id="afd3f1f4ea9" action-value="afd3f1f4ea9"
data-action="show-user-card" action-type="hover" target="_blank"} who
had worked on a similar project but in another context. We discussed the
intricacies of a specific piece of search functionality that I thought
would port over to our project well.

Because I'm only working on this project part time its hard to feel like
speedy progress is being made sometimes. Next week I'm going to try and
visualise my work in the office better and start printing out
screenshots of what I'm doing to help.
