It's both gratifying and unnerving to be singled out as an expert,
especially when you feel like you've making it up as you go, as I have!

You've nicely captured how I also feel about this situation.

It's both gratifying and unnerving to be singled out as an expert,
especially when you feel like you've making it up as you go, as I have!

I've found that I've had to get comfortable in saying 'I don't know'
more, without worrying that people won't keep coming back to me later.
They still do.

It can be hard working in a small team in a place where you've not got
anyone to learn from, but this can be a good opportunity to develop your
own confidence in your opinions and methods.

One of the problems I have when working with awesome peers and
inspirational mentors is that I sometimes make the assumption that they
are automatically right, which isn't true.

Being the only expert allows you to develop your confidence in asserting
yourself.
