Stuff we achieved this week:

-   [Mike spent two days in Sheffield running training]{#16ae}
-   [He also did his awesome talk on anxiety and finished a blog post
    about training]{#7f3c}
-   [I did some sifting for various contract and permanent roles]{#cde7}
-   [Sat on a mock assessment panel]{#ff1e}
-   [Did a workshop with service designers in immigration]{#1e1c}

**Monday** began with my earnest attempt at dedicating time to writing
about the case working meet-up. By mid-morning, I realised I would
probably need some help with this so have since roped in Mike to assist.
Speaking of Mike, he bravely left the comfort of London to venture North
to a crisp Sheffield. He and
[Amy](https://medium.com/@amy__everett){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://medium.com/@amy__everett"
target="_blank"} from the research team had organised a day of coding
and prototyping training for everyone in the office. Over the last
couple of months they have iterated and improved the training, which was
demonstrated in the great feedback from colleagues --- many of whom had
limited experience with coding and some who viewed it as some mystical
dark art.

I spent half an hour of the morning attempting to explain the
organisational structure of Digital, Data and Technology to a colleague.
It made my head hurt and I vowed to write this down in an understandable
format so I don't need to do it again.

In the afternoon I had a prep call with Rosanna from our Service
Standards team about a mock service assessment on Wednesday.

On **Tuesday** I prepared for a show and tell we're doing on the [Home
Office Design
System](https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, next week. Mike had stopped overnight
in order to run another day of activities. In the morning he facilitated
training around designing for access needs. In the afternoon we were
treated to his awesome talk on his experiences with anxiety and how he
manages it --- g[et in touch with
him](https://twitter.com/1mikeowen){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://twitter.com/1mikeowen" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} if you'd like him to do the talk at your government
department.

I left mid-afternoon as I was stopping in London overnight for tomorrows
mock service assessment, which started first thing in the morning.

I was in Croydon all day **Wednesday,** with most of the morning taken
up by the mock service assessment. It was a pretty positive session,
mostly focussing on preparing the team for their GDS alpha assessment.
It was great to hear comments from the service manager about how user
research has fed back up into decision making in the organisation.

In the afternoon I attended a Government as a Platform show and tell. I
was surprised how much things had changed since I'd last properly looked
at Gov UK Pay and Notify. The team emphasised how they wanted service
teams to get in touch with them if they din't do something that they
needed. They can often work with the team on it or add it to their back
log. It was great to hear about a Home Office service that will be using
Notify, Pay *and* Verify --- hopefully in the future this should be the
norm.

On **Thursday** I was back in Sheffield. I spent most of the day sifting
applications for a contract position and another permanent role that
recently closed.

My favourite part of the day was a workshop with some of the service
design team from immigration. We were looking at their work on trying to
build an end-to-end view of services as users would know them. We met to
talk about some ideas they had around building a prototype for a tool
that would help report on outcomes. It was great to do some proper
design-ery thinking for a change. I suggested to the team that the
project might be a good candidate for running a design sprint --- we're
going to chat more next week about it.

On **Friday** I was back down in London for training. I had a very
productive session on the train, finishing the previous days sifting and
reviewing a blog post. I headed over to GDS for Service Assessors
training, which was very informative. We did a bit of an icebreaker and
I learned that the person sat next to me lived about six miles away from
me and was shortly about to join the Home Office. I enjoyed the role
play we did, practicing various questioning and listening skills in a
mock assessment --- we have some pretty good actors (and potential
stand-up comedians) in our digital team.

More next week!
