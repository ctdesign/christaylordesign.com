This past week, we have been mostly:

-   [Attending the first public cross government design meet-up.]{#19a7}
-   [Helping out at the GDS Careers day.]{#2c4d}
-   [Mike has started getting some maintaining prototypes guidance
    together.]{#a04f}
-   [Sifting for the Junior Interaction Designer vacancy.]{#21d4}
-   [Reviewing the last three months of goals for Interaction Design and
    planning for the next three months]{#6a00}

**Monday** was spent attentively listening and enjoying the free
exhibits at the rather lovely Design Museum. This was on the occasion of
the first [public cross government
design](https://designmuseum.org/whats-on/talks-courses-and-workshops/london-design-festival-2017/cross-government-design-meetup){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://designmuseum.org/whats-on/talks-courses-and-workshops/london-design-festival-2017/cross-government-design-meetup"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} meet up, part of the annual London
Design Festival.

The format of the meet-up was slightly altered for the different
audience. Dan Hill, Director at Arup, started the day off and the
regular departmental updates were bumped to later on. I really enjoyed
his talk on design in the public and learning about some of the work his
company has been doing with cities.

I attended the Heads of Design meeting in the morning (I usually
represent the Home Office here when Katy can't make it). One of the
topics for discussion was how should line management be structured in
our respective design teams and if designers should only be managed by
other designers. I learned that there's quite a mix, with smaller design
teams having a much flatter structure. I think that it's vitally
important that a designer is involved in the professional development of
other designers, but no reasons that they need to perform all of the
admin functions of a line manager (approving holidays, expenses etc).

I stopped overnight in London in order to help out at **Tuesday's**
[Public Design Careers
Day](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/14/sign-up-to-the-next-design-in-the-public-sector-careers-day/){.markup--anchor

[Eliot](https://medium.com/@eliothill){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor

colleagues from NHS Digital and
[Snook](https://wearesnook.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor

on hand to help facilitate the activities and provide advice.

The attendees were a mix of students and people interested in a design
career in gov. [Louise
Downe](https://twitter.com/LouiseDowne?){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/LouiseDowne?"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} started the day with a talk about design
in government and the important of Service Design. The rest of the day
was made up with talks and a practical exercise where we split everyone
up into small groups and gave them a brief to work on. The idea was to
give them flavour of how we run a discovery, alpha and beta. I liked how
the attendees really embraced the prototyping phase --- one of the
groups overturned a table and attached hand drawn signs to act out how a
document scanner/photo booth hybrid could work. It was a really well
organised and fun day and I got the impression that the attendees got a
lot out of it.

A big chunk of **Wednesday** and **Thursday** was spent with
[Chris](https://medium.com/@WildSquirrelHub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://medium.com/@WildSquirrelHub"
target="_blank"} sifting applications for our Junior Interaction
Designer position. We had over 60 applications to go through. I must
have sifted several hundred applications in my career and I often see
the same mistakes repeated. I highly recommend people read [Mike's
article on making a good first
impression](https://medium.com/designnotes/make-an-impression-the-right-way-a67416d5f347){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://medium.com/designnotes/make-an-impression-the-right-way-a67416d5f347"
target="_blank"} and [this
one](https://medium.com/@loft27design/10-cv-tips-for-junior-graphic-designers-b5872c82cc1f#.os58tq9e7){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://medium.com/@loft27design/10-cv-tips-for-junior-graphic-designers-b5872c82cc1f#.os58tq9e7"
target="_blank"} from Stephen McCarthy about portfolios.

My main recommendations when applying for jobs with us are:

-   [Don't rate your proficiency in a particular skills, eg Illustration
    80%, Coding 75% --- it's meaningless.]{#a1a3}
-   [Try not to use acronyms --- don't make me work to understand your
    application.]{#3d55}
-   [Read the job description thoroughly, understand what you are
    applying for. Do your research with us --- we publish lots of
    information publicly.]{#bbb0}
-   [In your CV, try to think about your work in terms of your
    accomplishments. For example saying you 'designed a new checkout
    process' is ok but saying you 'designed a new checkout process that
    resulted in a 10% sales increase' is much better.]{#8b1f}
-   [For your employment history, don't list responsibilities or
    accomplishments that aren't relevant to the job you're applying for.
    Staking shelves in B&Q doesn't help me understand your suitability
    for a design role. Emphasising how you worked in team to meet
    certain deadlines is better.]{#9d73}
-   [Your application should be specific to the job you are applying
    for. You should look through the job description and think how you
    can relate your accomplishments to it. If the job mentions it wants
    someone with prototyping skills and knowledge of
    accessibility --- then make sure you mention it.]{#05a6}
-   [But be careful not to misrepresent your own impact. I've previously
    seen applicants claim wildly outlandish things which when you dig
    into the detail at interview, don't hold up.]{#3c91}
-   [For your portfolio, I want to know what you did on the project and
    what your process was. Don't just include screenshots. Describe the
    problem and what you did. Use subheadings and bullets --- make it
    easy for me to read.]{#3b05}
-   [For junior positions three or four good examples of work with well
    written case studies are better than 10 examples with no
    context.]{#006d}
-   [Don't over design it --- keep it simple. Mike makes an excellent
    point in his article:]{#c969}

I spent a bit of time on **Thursday** with Mike, reviewing [the
goals](https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes-1-making-plans-recruitment-and-design-patterns-9b0521495493){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes-1-making-plans-recruitment-and-design-patterns-9b0521495493"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} for the Interaction Design profession
that we set three months ago. We generally found that we'd achieved most
of what we wanted to, but recognised that we needed a bit more structure
and clear definition of what we're aiming to do. We spent a bit of time
coming up with an outline for the next three months of goals. Our
intention is to spend more time with delivery teams to learn how we can
help them. We're also going to try to run the Home Office Design System
more as a product and work towards increasing the design teams
engagement around it.

**Friday** was a bit of a tidy-up day. This weeks team meeting was
good --- team members were asking for feedback and everyone was chipping
in with suggestions and resources that could help. I carved out some
time to review my to-do list, turning my random thoughts in my inbox
into actionable items and reprioritising things.
