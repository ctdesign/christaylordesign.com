This week was a bumper London week --- with me spending nearly three
days there.

On **Monday**, [Gavin
Eliot](https://twitter.com/gavinelliott?lang=en){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/gavinelliott?lang=en"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} visited one of our regular User Research
& Design meet-ups to do his amazing talk on Imposter Syndrome. Although
I already heard him present this at the cross-gov design meet-up last
month, I think I got more out of it a second time.

I spent a decent chunk of **Tuesday** adding some new functionality to
the Centre of Excellence site. We've had a several meetings throughout
the week to decide on changes following testing. This is intended to be
a quick internal solution to explain to other parts of the Home Office
what we can offer, as part of our wider engagement.

Why not just add that information to our intranet, you may sensibly ask?
Ah, but (of course) not everyone in our organisation can access that.

So, we've published it as a static site on Github pages, to make it
easier for people to contribute and save us the overhead of servers and
CMS's. I've enjoyed contributing to the actual design and coding of
this, instead of just overseeing things --- it's been a nice change.

I had a busy morning on **Wednesday** as I tried to cram in a bunch of
small jobs. I was travelling down to London later on in the day and
would be in training all day Thursday. I had a meeting to discuss
suitable projects for the new interns to shadow on. I also spent some
time revising guidance I've been writing on an Interaction Design Health
check. I've managed to get loads of good feedback on it this week, so
I'm hopeful it will become a really useful tool.

**Thursday** was my favourite day. Myself (and known pedant)
[Charles](https://twitter.com/charles_rt){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/charles_rt"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} spent all day at a Design Sprint
facilitation session ran by the author of the [Design Sprint
book](https://www.thesprintbook.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}, [Jake

Charles has previously ran a couple of Design Sprints in the Home Office
and we want to do more. We see it as a useful tool to kickstart ideas
and help delivery teams who struggle to know what direction to go in.

There were around 100 people at the Tate Modern for the training. This
session focussed on the first three days of the design sprint process.
This was mostly because we only had a day to go through everything, but
also because these days comprise the essential backbone of the sprint.

We conducted a mini-sprint throughout the day using a fake company (but
based on a real one he had consulted for) . This meant we could learn
the hows and whys of the techniques from a participant and facilitator
point of view. Jake shared with us many extra insights he's learned
since writing the book and told us a few things he would probably change
now.

Although I had already read the book a couple of times, I got a lot out
of the training. I find that I learn best when I combine reading with
being able to practically do a thing soon after. I never feel like I
retain information from books particularly well, but when I'm able to
combine it with practicing, I find I'm able to magically recall stuff
I've previously read. It seems to be the combination of both that works
best for me.

**Friday** consisted mostly of various meetings. I had a call regarding
planning for the [Design in the public sector careers
day](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/14/sign-up-to-the-next-design-in-the-public-sector-careers-day/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/14/sign-up-to-the-next-design-in-the-public-sector-careers-day/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in a few weeks. I managed to source more
volunteers from the design team and have begun putting together the
brief for the sessions we'll be running --- it should be a great day.

We have our first graphic designer starting with us next week --- so
I've been busily collecting projects for her. Her role will be to fulfil
some of the ad hoc design requests we get (which are normally squeezed
in by our Interaction Designers) and also serve as a resource that
delivery teams can access --- for example, to visualise service maps or
help with assisted digital print materials. Once I started putting the
word our we had someone, it didn't take long for a trickle of requests
to get much bigger. We're going to try and manage the work in Trello and
see how we go.

We've had a lot of interest in our vacancies this week, particularly our
Junior Interaction Designer:

I found myself replying to prospective applicants with the same kind of
advice, so I put together a list of useful things to read on github,
which I'll continue to add to:
