Some stuff we did this week:

-   [Mike ran another training session for non-designers using git and
    the prototyping kit.]{#0d48}
-   [I spent a good chunk of the week on performance and goal setting
    and staffing related things.]{#5d9c}
-   [More planning for the Designing Case-working Systems
    meet-up.]{#c456}

Another pretty quiet one this week due to people being on holiday. I've
tried to work through some of those odd jobs and half written blog posts
you put aside when everything's busy -- so it's proven to be a welcome
change of pace.

We had the first of our Interaction Design team meetings in our new
weekly format on Friday. It was notably better attended and it was good
to get everyone to reflect on their working week. Doing it remotely via
Google Hangouts seemed to work best, with me acting as facilitator.

I've also spent a bit of time this week on developing the agenda for the
[Designing Case-working
Systems](http://attending.io/events/designing-case-working-systems){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://attending.io/events/designing-case-working-systems"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} meet-up. As of a few minutes ago, 60
people across government have signed up, which has blown me away. This
may present a bit of a problem with the venue capacity but we'll get
around that, I'm sure. The interest in it seems to have validated my
hypothesis that there is a need for more guidance and help around this
theme.

But I've been also been thinking about what happens beyond this meet-up.

Kate Tarling has already [written brilliantly
about](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/20/building-internal-systems-v-providing-services/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/20/building-internal-systems-v-providing-services/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} how we need to look at the whole service
and consider the reasons we are doing checks and what problems the
system actually solves. This absolutely needs to be the first
consideration in the design process. However, despite that, we will
probably still have a need for case-working systems --- albeit simpler,
faster ones that don't get in the way of case-workers actually doing
their job.

In the short term, I think there will be a lot of value in contributing
to the on-going work across government on design systems. It would be
great to be in a position so that any team considering a case-working
system has a well researched set of design patterns and components that
will give them a massive head start and save them time and money.

But beyond design patterns --- what else could the aim be?

I've been wondering about the feasibility of a cross-government,
open-source case-working system. That would save *a lot* of time and
money (I've heard something like 60% of government is case-working).

This might sound naïve and overly ambitious --- also not terribly
original. Ambitious goals like this usually have some kind of central
funding, stakeholders, governance etc.

But is that an old fashioned way of thinking?

Why can't we build something with the principles of open-source software
from the start, maybe coordinated by a small council of people who can
steer things in the right way? One of my favourite things about working
in government is peoples willingness to work around inter-departmental
bullshit to make things better for actual users.

If there's willingness by individuals in teams to contribute back to the
guidance and codebase, for people to take this as a starting point and
iterate and improve, there's no good reason we couldn't make it work. It
would never be a *finished* product--- but then, software never is.
That's a long way off and there are numerous technical and architectural
hurdles to be addressed, but why not?

We don't need to wait for 'permission' for this --- it just needs
cooperation, openness and a clear vision. We, the people who design and
build these things, can decide for ourselves to do this.

This kind of thing is one of the reasons I wanted to work in
government --- for a small group of people to enact massive change is a
powerful idea that gets me excited about the possibilities.

I hope that others share my sentiment.
