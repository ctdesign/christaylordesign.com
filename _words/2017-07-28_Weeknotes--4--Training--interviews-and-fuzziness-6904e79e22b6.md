The week started with a long day in our Westminster office, centred
around our regular user-centred design community meet-up. This weeks was
a show and tell on an immigration service, some insight into best
practices around documenting research findings and learnings from
processing passport applications.

For the interaction design team meeting we did a 'lightning' show and
tell --- everyone is given just three minutes to show something their
working on. The focus of this helps me get a good sense of what everyone
is working on and understand some of the design problems they're coming
across. Two of the designers were working on very similar problems and
decided to pair up to work on it further --- this is always great to
see.

For me, most of the rest of the week was was spent interviewing for our
interaction design lead roles. I always seem to underestimate the amount
of time it takes to coordinate, print out things and get the rooms
ready --- but the preparation really helps ensure the candidates have as
smooth an experience as possible and that the panel members make the
best use of their time. As I've previously said we had some excellent
candidates as well.

Mike did some great work in planning and organising Access Needs
training this week. Quite a few people collaborated on developing the
content and Mike delivered this pilot session. We wanted to make
something that helped designers understand more of the practicalities
that they need to consider when designing inclusive services. One of the
things we tried is making a mock government service (applying for a
Space travel visa) which had some obvious and not so obvious
accessibility issues and asking attendees to work together to identify
the issues. It seemed to go well and we got some great feedback.

I realised this week that I've started using the word *fuzzy* a lot to
describe the procedures within government. When I first joined as a
civil servant I naively expected really clear policies and guidelines,
but I instead find a lot of it is *fuzzy*. It can be really difficult to
find out who is ultimately responsible for things, certain policies and
procedures assume access to systems that aren't easily available and you
can spend weeks in email loops as well-meaning people bounce your query
around from person to person. We need a lot less fuzziness and a lot
more simpler ways to get things done.

I visited the Department for Education's office in Sheffield on Friday
to check the space we'll be hosting the [Gov Design Sheffield
event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sheffield-gov-design-meetup-tickets-36314345184){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sheffield-gov-design-meetup-tickets-36314345184"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. They have a beautiful modern office
there and we've managed to get a lovely corner room for the event with a
great view of Sheffield. Very much looking forward to it. I've now
finished the timings and agenda --- just the millions of small details
to complete now and we'll all be set for the 16th August.

I spent a bit of time this week helping a colleague set up a really
simple site for reporting regularly on a project. It uses Github pages
powered by markdown to manage the content but you don't need to setup
anything locally, it can all be setup and managed via the Github browser
interface. You can fork your own copy here:

be improved at all.
