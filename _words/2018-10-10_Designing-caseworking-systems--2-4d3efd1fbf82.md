*Over the last year I organised two meet-ups for people designing
caseworking systems in government. Previously I'd hosted write-ups of
the events on a dedicated site
(*[*https://cross-gov-caseworking.herokuapp.com*](https://cross-gov-caseworking.herokuapp.com/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://cross-gov-caseworking.herokuapp.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}*) but as that site is password protected (because
reasons) I thought it would be better to move over the write-ups of the
events to Medium for better visibility.*

In March 2018 I ran the second designing caseworking systems meet-up at
Newspeak House, London.

Below are some notes from the day.

*Big thanks to Caroline Trimm, Rosie Cowling and Lynne Roberts for the
hard work taking notes.*

### Agenda {#0c68 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0c68"}

We should talk more about designing and building internal systems. About
half of our work at Home Office seems to be on case-working systems.

But there's a reluctance to speak about internal systems --- some I
think from a fear of exposing our decision-making processes.

But if we don't talk about these things, we'll lose them. We can save
more time and money by talking about these things more.

There's a tendency to outsource internal systems. Why can't we get to
the point where we have a starter kit where anyone working on a
caseworking system can use --- one stop shop with guidance and code in
there to help people get started?

People might think 'we'll wait for GDS to do something about
this' --- but we don't need to wait for them to do it, we in departments
are the ones who are doing it, so we need to surface that as much as
possible.

I made a website after the last meetup that catalogues screenshots of
different caseworking tools for designers to reference:

#### **Chris & Joe from DWP, talking about their work in Universal Credit to make case management easier** {#c473 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="c473"}

<figure id="9708" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fv9LtKYKVBIHPhIFBFhkgA.jpeg"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Fv9LtKYKVBIHPhIFBFhkgA.jpeg"
data-width="5184" data-height="3456" />
</figure>

There's two main user needs for Universal Credit

1.  [making sure people have enough money]{#97bd}
2.  [getting people into work/more stable work]{#41e0}

There are around:

-   [400,000 claimants]{#d89b}
-   [9,000 agents]{#003e}
-   [30 service centres]{#de00}
-   [268 job centres]{#031f}

There are different user roles of the caseworking system

-   [Work coach]{#71db}
-   [Case managers --- do all the stuff to make sure people get paid,
    answer questions people have about getting a job]{#b9ee}
-   [Decision makers --- person that decides whether someone is eligible
    for a benefit or not]{#2f79}

**Goals for work coaches**

1.  [Making sure they understand someone's situation, where they are at
    with their claim]{#9102}
2.  [Knowing about something critical that might change how you support
    someone]{#b488}

**Problems with caseworking system**

-   [Content is poorly organised]{#3b78}
-   [Actions are poorly labelled]{#15c1}
-   [Analytics on case working dashboard --- 2 of the 20-odd sections
    were used 66% of the time (Internal case history, looking at
    claimants account).]{#b52e}
-   [There's a tendency for dashboards to have poor information
    hierarchy.]{#3e88}
-   [No persistent navigation --- adds seconds to each action, which all
    adds up.]{#2ef2}
-   [Some things in the system are rarely used, if ever]{#758c}

**Consequences**

-   [Agents miss important things that has a negative effect on
    claimants]{#7b2d}
-   [It just takes longer to do things, takes a long time to learn how
    to navigate the system, they've seen agents creating their own
    glossary of terms]{#e7bb}
-   [It's hard to add new functionality (like accessing a payment
    statement to see what claimants are getting paid)]{#a727}

We did three rounds of card sorting, and five rounds of usability
testing

We designed a prototype:

<figure id="9d83" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vsBZqo3AMnDIiC2l"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*vsBZqo3AMnDIiC2l" data-width="1400"

class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*tz8gvusCT8zxbaDI" data-width="1400"
data-height="1050" />
</figure>

-   [There was no categorisation of recent history --- new design
    divides a claimant's history into blocks.]{#d9f9}
-   [We added labels for users to quickly glance at what an entry into
    the history is about]{#e0b6}
-   [Issue of misinformation as different users are using different
    parts of the system]{#f775}
-   [Able to filter history as well]{#45c4}
-   [Agent can 'pin' important notes --- they appear on the claim
    overview]{#d813}
-   [About surfacing vulnerability --- important that caseworkers can
    see this information]{#9915}
-   [Notes were becoming less relevant over time because markers were
    getting lost, making a case difficult to keep up to date over
    time]{#a122}
-   [Work Coach and Case Manager have different needs most of the time,
    with occasional overlap]{#5ecf}
-   [Notify upcoming things]{#1cc6}
-   [Preview content]{#a5b3}
-   [Need to surface important information]{#55c1}
-   [Provide single source of truth by giving contextual
    guidance]{#b01c}
-   [We found that there is poor internet connectivity in job
    centres --- it's important to have a light page load.]{#bd49}
-   [Their changes resulted in 20% reduction in pageviews (less jumping
    around pages).]{#7808}

**Research findings**

-   [Don't assume staff have better digital skills]{#48d1}
-   [Users didn't understand what a browser was, or that they were
    actually online]{#be33}

**Assumptions from previous system**

-   [Lots of people not looking at top quarter of the page because in
    previous designs, that part of the page didn't have useful
    information]{#ac23}
-   [For meaningful insight recreate as accurately as possible what the
    release experience --- the act of being involved gives them a
    natural predisposition that the thing is better]{#6522}

It's important to consider onboarding, rather than just releasing the
new thing to hundreds of people.

Need to manage expectations --- prepare people for the release of the
new thing.

#### Q&A {#1501 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="1501"}

Q. Was it a success?

A. Released an update few weeks ago, analytics so far show massive
reduction in page loads, increased communication. Reaction from
agents --- initially quite upset, but they are getting used to it.

#### Catherine from Citizens Advice talking about 'The Story of Casebook' {#317f .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="317f"}

<figure id="1c5d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bi9JMXfMeSgiONMCaL5gkg.jpeg"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bi9JMXfMeSgiONMCaL5gkg.jpeg"
data-width="4485" data-height="2910" />
</figure>

Citizens Advice recently built their own case management system and
rolled it out to their network of 23,000 volunteers.

Dual role of Citizens Advice

-   [Advice --- help people solve the problem in their life]{#0011}
-   [Advocacy --- log the cause and try to fix the cause of the problem
    in society]{#fea7}

Last year they helped 2.7 million people, and advised on 6.3 million
problems

When people have a problem, they come to see Citizens Advice. They share
their information with Citizens Advice and that information needs to be
stored in a case management system --- needs to hold millions of pieces
of data, be secure, be usable. It's not just a design problem.

Case management is a lot wider than 'how do you make it useful'

**Casebook**

Very different to the old system, which had been bought off the shelf.

They asked everyone what features they wanted --- and they got loads and
loads of features.

When they launched the old system it was a massive change and caused
large upheaval across the network

Most case management systems do everything for everyone but nothing very
well.

They wanted to change the focus onto staff and volunteers.

**What they learnt**

-   [Designing with people to make the technology useful is very
    important]{#9187}
-   [People volunteer because they want to make a difference and help
    people, not to spend time using an IT system]{#dc0c}
-   [Saving just a few seconds per task can add up to a huge amount of
    time that can be spent serving users. Their case write-up time has
    been halved, saving over 24 yrs of time.]{#e206}

They shared a demo site so users could see changes and watch them
work --- this allowed users to see the changes that were being made, so
the newness of if didn't happen on day one because the users were
already familiar with it.

Need to design and build in multidisciplinary teams. Sit together, plan
together, problem solve and argue together

> *"It's not just about building a caseworking system, it's about
> integrating it into our organisation"*

Think wider than just the product. Well designed products can change
behaviour.

They did get some things wrong --- they tried to strip away some things
that they thought were unimportant and users complained --- but because
they were working in an agile way, when they found that something was an
important feature they were able to put back in.

### Q&A {#85ca .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="85ca"}

Q. Were volunteers able to use the caseworking system while out helping
people at Grenfell Tower?

A. Yes, he was able to set up a remote station there and help people at
their location.

Q. How did you deal with challenging feedback?

A. Overwhelmingly positive feedback, but there is the change management
side, preparing users for change. They took a train the trainer approach
as they wouldn't be able to train everyone.

Q. Some reluctance to provide training within Govt (because it should be
easy to use by default), how did you address that?

A. Train the trainer approach worked well, training for previous system
took 5 days, new training took half a day.

Q. Was the full team available from the outset?

A. Project grew, at the beginning wasn't appropriate to have a support
team. The idea was there but they flexed according to their needs.

#### Elle Tweedy from Futuregov talking about 'Designing world class children's services' {#f428 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="f428"}

<figure id="f60c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4">
<img

data-width="4879" data-height="2991" />
</figure>

Futuregov provide services in local government and beyond.

Westminster, Kensington & Chelsea and Hammersmith & Fulham are three top
boroughs for delivering children's services across the country. Staff
there are doing their jobs in spite of the technology they've been
given. They are held back by the technology. Three different boroughs,
three different case management systems, this is extremely costly.

Following 18 months of scoping they realised there was nothing suitable
on the market. Following that, FutureGov ran a 6 month discovery.

When you talk to a social worker, they can't help but talk about the
tech --- they wanted to try to stop them talking about the jargon and
get them talking about the social work they are doing.

There is a high turnover of social workers, technology is exacerbating
the issue.

There's a lack of transparency, people can't see the notes that have
been written about them, which leads to difficulties building
relationships with families, lack of trust.

The technology people are using in their personal life is so different
to the tech they are using in their work life.

**Re-designing the experience**

They created an end to end experience for social workers --- but there's
a huge org design/service design piece of work underneath that
experience

Key principles

-   [Spend more time with families, less time in front of
    computers]{#ea12}
-   [Tech should support social care practice]{#8ad8}
-   [Decisions should be collaborative and tech should enable
    this]{#5655}
-   [Decisions should be visible to families, let them see what the
    record says]{#107b}

**What now?**

They have 10 months to test whether they are going in the right
direction.

Aim to develop an alpha service across child protection to improve the
lives of social workers, families and young people.

Testing three concepts to see if these are the things that will help
improve the experience:

1.  [Recording with families --- accessing and recording information on
    the go, improving transparency, sharing that information with
    families]{#f21c}
2.  [Family view --- what can we provide families to give them an idea
    of what the process is and where they are in that process.
    Everything in one place, allowing families to keep track of what's
    going on]{#4234}
3.  [Single view --- single record capturing all activity, creating a
    clear narrative that informs decision making, allowing workers to
    coordinate, leading to better decision making]{#b648}

Organisation design sits closely alongside the technology --- how to
enable behaviour change?

**Q&A**

Q. If I turn up with my mobile in someone's home, has there been any
feedback that that may come across as trivialising someone's experience?

A. Social workers are starting to use iPads --- different barriers
between computer, phone and tablet --- tablets seem to encourage a more
'shared' approach between agent and user

Q. Working with three different councils, how will you coordinate
organisational change across all three councils?

A. Hugely complex, but fundamentally their outcomes are the same, to
help families. It's the way they go about doing it that's different.

Q. Logistics question, you talk about a discovery being six months and
alpha being 10 months, how do you keep interest and motivation high with
those people you are working with?

A. Huge fatigue around new systems, the more we can do in the open.
Roadshows every two weeks, going and presenting and showing the work.
Thinking of creating a blog, then it's out there and people can see it.
They did a similar thing in Australia and it helped to create a
community.

### Afternoon --- unconference {#1552 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="1552"}

We experimented with running an unconference session in the afternoon
which seemed to go really well and generated lots of interesting
discussions.

We ran a pitching session first and then planned out the rest of the
afternoon on a whiteboard running 4 group discussions.

#### **#1: Discussion around using one-thing-per page on internal systems, by Alice Noakes, GDS** {#c2f4 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="c2f4"}

**Notes**

HMCTS --- caseworker system for caseworkers and solicitors. Both like
different approaches (solicitors like one thing per page). Solicitors
are digital users. Caseworkers are more used to forms.

Need to define what 'thing' means, ie what is the question? A process?
Sometimes a dashboard is necessary. It depends on the process, ie a
'thing' could be a person, including their name, date of birth and
address.

DWP --- agents got frustrated with one thing per page. Now we group
things like 'claimant details' and 'partner details' (each one thing),
to remove some stress.

Defra --- "feedback on one question per page is not something I can
repeat!" Brevity counts. Simplifying things isn't necessarily correct if
you're doing it all day every day.

DWP --- we're replacing a Word doc to ask for digital staff. Criteria:
there may be up to 30 jobs available at a time.

Home Office --- trying to explore patterns since started (new to govt
from commercial world). Do we explore examples from the commercial
worlds, eg claims practices that exist like insurance? Customer
relationship management systems? (DWP --- found that insurance claims
services are prehistoric) These are common tasks. Personal experience
working with banks. Internal systems aren't invested in, but have we got
examples about the end to end approach? We have spoken about the
importance of managing \[stakeholder and customer\] expectations.

People have to understand what the whole service is about, or they only
learn their particular workflow, but they don't always understand why
they're doing it, so they can't understand how to improve or iterate the
service. We get paper scanning, so people are checking if it's been
scanned right. If it was one thing per page, it would take them so long.

*Examples of when their idea didn't work? Ie one question per page
didn't work, it was about types of information?*

Home Office --- have we explored other channels, like chat rooms instead
of online systems

Citizens Advice --- we have to integrate all our interactions into one
place, new web chat platform to integrate chat into case mgmt system. Or
an API. Go with a tech solution.

--- seeing what has happened takes longer than it should because loads
of people are inputting case notes. How do you filter the important
thing?

--- in NHS we had to put roadblocks in place to stop clinicians going
through scans too fast to ensure quality and prevent missing key
information.

DWP --- we tried chucking everything on one page and tagged every error
message to see which validation errors were coming up (on a dashboard).
Went back to observe how agents were behaving and they were hitting page
down on a keyboard and what they needed was going off the page, so they
were missing it.

GDS failed an internal system because it went through external
assessment. You have to make sure you're telling your story in the
assessment because assessors are human. You need to show that you've
done research and testing and 'one thing per page' doesn't work for your
users.

GDS patterns are very much citizen facing. GDS needs to recognise that
internal users are different.

It would be useful to have user research from these projects collated
internally so we're not repeating the same things.

DWP --- has a github repo with screenshots of designs to see patterns:
[https://github.com/dwp/design-examples/issues](https://github.com/dwp/design-examples/issues){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://github.com/dwp/design-examples/issues" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}

Local govt --- would be good to see a design pattern for allocating work
in systems (eg IT support hub).

DWP --- It's usually better to change the content as you can control
that easier than the interaction.

Local govt --- at what point do you ignore users? Sometimes people who
do not use digital at all in personal life navigate extremely complex
systems. They are used to very complicated systems and it is muscle
memory.

HMPO --- examiners say they want "holistic approach" to examining (ie
seeing everything related to an application), but need to do specific
tasks. There is a timeline available to them so they can see everything
if they want but generally they don't need to, to do a task.

**Summary**

-   [Sometimes one thing per page works, sometimes it doesn't (depends
    on context)]{#90f5}
-   [It depends how you define a 'thing']{#0cec}
-   [Different between what caseworker needs and says they want]{#f50a}
-   [Maybe a 'thing' is a task, or group of information]{#df28}

#### #2 Discussion around designing for expert users, do they need to be trained? by Andrew Travers, HO {#a53f .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="a53f"}

Emma, IPO: \
Main focus is on external services and users, senior management doesn't
want to put user researchers on internal services. Lone voice at the
minute.

Lynne, HO: \
How much caseworkers are thinking about when progressing through a case,
do they really need training to use the tools?

Andrew, HO: \
Would like to think about how we switch the context from designing
services for people who have never encountered a service before and
might only use it once in their life, to expert users who may use a
system for 8 hours a day.

Jewell, HO: \
Observation from research: People are nervous to say they struggle to do
something because it's their job, people felt intimidated to ask for
help, nervous to click on things and see what happens (afraid of the
consequences), because they are working to targets they are nervous to
try anything new in case th

Robert, Passports\
Principle within passports is no training because senior managers have
said they don't have the budget for training.

Important principle: have the same terminology for things helps to make
things clearer

Do you design explicitly for novices, or new users?

If it's a new thing, you won't know what the expert behaviours are for a
few years

Common problem: people become so institutionalised with how a process
works, their whole life is focussed around a process that we're trying
to get rid of

Bill, HMCTS:\
Working on caseworking system for judges

Currently all paper based, judges want to be trained on whatever they
are going to be given. Trying to deliver something that will work across
civil law, family law and tribunals. Trying to design something that
allows certain flexibility with how they work.

When tasks are so boring and monotonous, you introduce risk into the
system

Kate Tarling is trying to move the place where design happens to earlier
in the service lifecycle at the HO

> *"A lot of these systems are just given to users and they don't have
> an explanation as to why something is they way it is...they want to
> know why things have been done in a particular way"*

> *"Every time you're releasing an update to the application, you're
> having to release an update to the supporting materials too"*

**Do we need to teach people how to use a service?**

Looking beyond what users say they need --- might result in a different
process to existing. Where is the learning and development, is it in the
process or in the tool?

People should be trained in their roles --- their jobs are complicated
enough --- shouldn't need training to use an interface

Establishing common language --- people end up writing their own
guidance if different users are using different terminology.

Some users want to be trained --- classroom type training (eg judges and
analysts). May be afraid to admit they don't understand
something --- but if service is intuitive enough this shouldn't happen.

**New users/experts**

How we switch context from designing for people who haven't used a
service before or may use it only once, to internal users who use it
repeatedly daily.

They will develop hacks/workarounds to do things as quickly as possible
& they become muscle memory/take them for granted.

People become institutionalised to the way a process works, and any
deviation causes problems --- people's lives work around a process which
we then get rid of.

Users get attached to workarounds because:

-   [they are seen to be the experts]{#4a04}
-   [they may not be the best way of doing things but it's what they
    know]{#0a7c}
-   [they may be under pressure to do something quickly, so may be
    reluctant to try something new]{#1e43}

If it's new software you may not yet know what the expert behaviours are
going to be.

If there's a high turnover of staff you may be designing for novice
users. But step by step would be frustrating and hamper productivity.

Wizard style approach --- help/hints which appear the first time you use
something?

**How far we automate**

We don't want to design a 'digital battery farm.' Eg, user-written
emails can be riddled with errors but if you remove that autonomy
people's tasks are boring (which may introduce risk into the system). If
there's anything we can do to make the task more interesting, we should.

Can we get to a place where we have a starter kit for caseworking
systems with standards, guidance and code in it?

It should be possible to define a list of common tasks.

What is a caseworking system?

A thing that helps an internal staff member record the decision making
process for a thang and be able to manage a complex case of an
individual so other people working on it can understand the status of
the case.

There's a difference between case working (backlog of applications) and
case management (ongoing relationship with the thing)

Collecting the things that everyone is doing will help us to understand
what others are doing --- lots of building blocks

*"I imagine something the GDS design elements page, something like that,
a place where you can lift bits from others and use them in your own
service"*

*"Or at least, there's somewhere you can have a discussion"*

Want to know what design patterns have worked well, in what context, and
why --- and the why is really important to know --- something that says
*"I designed this, it tested well in this context with these users"*

The format of how things are described is really important to people

Chris Taylor\
New GDS design system will tell people why to use certain things --- but
do our needs differ as users building internal caseworking systems?

Craig Abbot --- DWP\
We are using github to track issues, applying a template to an issue, so
that people can add information on why something is/isn't working

Q. How do you define what the thing is (pattern, component)? Is it up to
the designer to make that call?

A. Workshop helped them to identify what things were. Everyone throw
their designs out there, then we can see how many people are working on
things and have a workshop to talk about them.

Q. How can a cross gov community work together on patterns?

A. Ahead of a meet up --- just chuck stuff up, be open --- anything. The
use a meet up to hone ideas down --- face-to-face reduces the technical
barriers

If HO and DWP and others solve search, we'll have five different
solutions to the same thing

Chris

*"We need to just stop the assumption that we can buy off the shelves
and that will solve all our problems"*

What's the cost of this --- we intuitively know that off-the-shelf
systems don't work --- can we prove this over time by working together.

Lenny Martin HO\
Focus on casework (workflow), took the same approach as HMCTS

Define workflow, that's the bare bones of your caseworking system, take
the UI out of the question, define the tech flow, then think about UI
once that's clearly defined.

Make sure the workflow is configurable enough first (HO example where
every task has to be shown on every screen because that's how it was
built)

Share research on a slack channel or trello, make sure its anonymous
enough to be shareable

2 people in group of 17 don't know how to use github

> *"It's not intuitive, its very much for design patterns, trello might
> be better for sharing research"*

**Summary**

We had a really good discussion. People seemed to agree that there would
never be a one size fits all kit.

But maybe we could have a combination of:

-   [a modular, configurable workflow engine]{#80a0}
-   [a set of robust guidance and example coded components]{#e9b7}
-   [making user research finding more open]{#abce}

We could make a trello board for research findings.

Maybe use a future meetup to discuss and refine the collection of
various design patterns (for example, bringing all search examples from
different systems and choose the best one that works)

Could we get some principles together? For example:

-   [Design caseworking systems assuming they need to be consumed and
    integrated by other gov teams]{#a6e9}
-   [Modular, loosely coupled]{#152e}

Lynne suggested the idea of making a big list of needs and tasks that
people need to complete.

One interesting discussion was around the different between caseworking
and case management.

**Caseworking** could be defined as a very linear process with a
specific outcome (a yes/no decision for example, like processing a visa
application)

**Case management** is more fuzzy, with no obvious outcome (like
benefits). Typically one worker may stay with the user for a while.

Its easier to design and build rules etc around caseworking and can be
more automated.
