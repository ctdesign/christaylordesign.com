Every two weeks on a Monday, the user-centred design community has a
meet-up in our Westminster office, which I always look forward to.

We either have an external speaker or an in-depth show and tell. Today's
was a talk by [Clare
Ridd](https://twitter.com/clareridd){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://twitter.com/clareridd" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} on the things she's learned in researching for assisted
digital users. It was a great talk with real, practical insights --- I
learned that often the problem isn't one of technology and 'AD Users'
aren't really a thing.

We always have our Interaction Design team meeting on the same Monday.
We've been experimenting with structuring them in a different
way --- one meeting a month is a workshop/training opportunity and one
is a show and tell or design crit.

For this session, I talked through the latest changes to our design
patterns and reiterated the process for contributing to them. All of our
[documentation is
open](https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and our [code is on
GitHub](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. We've made a lot of progress recently
with this and I try and seek any opportunity to raise awareness. In a
few weeks I will be arranging a show and tell with the wider Digital,
Data and Technology organisation to highlight this important piece of
work.

I'm also arranging to do short talks at other professional communities
around the Home Office about Interaction Design and how to work with
designers. I spent a bit of time this week arranging slots and preparing
my slides.

We have some new designers starting soon, so I also took the opportunity
to update our induction Trello board. We've had some really good
feedback on this and we've shared our version (which we based on [GDS's
version](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/23/introduction-to-the-new-induction/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/23/introduction-to-the-new-induction/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}) with other teams in the Home Office.

I had a bit of a setback this week on an important project. As often
happens in large organisations, a seemingly sensible decision from
senior managers created a bit of a problem for me*.* I was frustrated by
this but couldn't see a way past it --- fortunately [Katy
Arnold](https://twitter.com/katyarnie?lang=en){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/katyarnie?lang=en"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} persisted and managed to alter the
course of the decision enough that we could continue doing what we
wanted, for the time being. Katy (as always) showed me how important the
value of persistence is in working in government and not taking no for
an answer on important things.
