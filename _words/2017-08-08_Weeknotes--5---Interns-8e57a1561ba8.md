Key thing we did last week:

-   [Interviewed all of our Interaction Design Intern candidates]{#4774}

Last week was a relatively short one for both me and Mike as we both
were on annual leave (sadly, not together).

Monday and Tuesday was spent interviewing a rather impressive array of
potential interns in London and Sheffield. The candidates were a mix of
recent graduates as well as people who were looking for a career change.
It's a bit of an understatement to say that it will be difficult to make
our final decision.

Our internship programme has already been running for a few years within
the user research team (spearheaded and managed by
[Claire](https://twitter.com/clareridd){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/clareridd"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in-between her day job as a researcher)
and this marks the second year we've had it within the interaction
design team.

Our current awesome interns, Megan and
[Simon](https://twitter.com/simcastillo){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/simcastillo"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, spend their time learning, working on a
delivery team and managing their own project (building a website for our
popular [accessibility
posters](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}).
[Mike](https://twitter.com/1mikeowen){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://twitter.com/1mikeowen" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} has been looking after the interaction design side of
the internship programme and has set-up an [internship learning
plan](https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/designinternships/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/designinternships/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, which is customised according to the
interns particular skills and experience.

The Home Office has now hired someone full-time to manage and develop
our internship programme across more professions, which is really
exciting. We are also working to open up opportunities for interns to
apply for full-time positions at the end of their year with us.

In [my previous
weeknotes](https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes-4-fuzziness-6904e79e22b6){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes-4-fuzziness-6904e79e22b6"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, I talked about how the the lack of
clarity and ownership of things in government (or fuzziness) causes
frustration.

One of our Service Managers, Greg Smith (who has, quite possibly, the
most soothing voice in government) made a great observation I wanted to
share:

Sometime the very fuzziness that frustrates is also is the opportunity
to actually get things done. An excellent point.

More next week!
