A short week for me, as I spent Monday and Tuesday enjoying a belated
wedding anniversary break with my wife. Turns out that wandering around,
consuming vast quantities of tapas and guzzling wine in the sun are
excellent ways to spend your time.

### Things that happened thing week {#8743 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="8743"}

#### Doing analysis as a team {#0eb6 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--h3 name="0eb6"}

As part of a project I'm working on to figure out ways we can use our
research to improve decision making, we got together as a team to
collaboratively analyse and discuss our research. We teased out some
good insights and, along with our Product Owners' expertise, we left
with a better idea of what we did and didn't know. Initially I felt a
bit dazed and unsure as to whether we were in a better place or not, but
in writing up the session I feel that we have a much better grounding in
what we need to learn about next. It's always worthwhile backing up what
you think you know with some actual evidence.

#### Reading interesting things {#f076 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--p name="f076"}

As part of the background reading for this project, I came across a few
really interesting reports and articles:

-   [[How to be an effective
    minister](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Ministers_Reflect_WEB.pdf){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor
    data-href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Ministers_Reflect_WEB.pdf"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"}\
    From the Institute of Government, this is an interesting publication
    that recommends more support for ministers who often are thrusted
    into their roles with no help or relevant experience. I didn't
    realise that there's not really a job description or much in the way
    of clear objectives when they are put into post. Very
    illuminating.]{#cb62}
-   [[Show your
    working](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/show-your-workings){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor
    data-href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/show-your-workings"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"}\
    Another Institute of Government report on developing a tool to
    assess the transparency of evidence in policy-making. Will be
    interesting at a later stage to refer back to this for my
    project.]{#0533}
-   [[A short guide to policy for government digital
    professionals](https://medium.com/@maltbyps/one-team-government-a-short-guide-to-policy-for-government-digital-professionals-c3cc1e421406){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor
    data-href="https://medium.com/@maltbyps/one-team-government-a-short-guide-to-policy-for-government-digital-professionals-c3cc1e421406"
    target="_blank"}\
    Probably relatively well known by people who read these, but
    something really useful to keep referring back to to understand what
    the dark art of policy actually is.]{#a96b}

#### I now love Hamilton {#7499 .graf .graf--h4 .graf-after--li name="7499"}

After buying tickets about a year and half ago, me and my wife finally
got to go and see what all the fuss was about.

For me, it really lived up to the hype. Great performances and it was
just so bloody impressive how they managed to sing beautifully, rap
eloquently, whilst remembering all of the lyrics as well as jumping
around, dancing at the same time. An impressively, enjoyable feat.

### What I learned this week {#0746 .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--p name="0746"}

I need to put an actual plan in place to manage my time.

Over the last few weeks I've felt a bit stretched over lots of different
things and have resolved to finally start properly planning my working
week better so that I feel like I am achieving something tangible come
Friday.

All too often, I fall into the trap of work happening to me, rather than
me taking an active role in shaping my week. To fix this I'm going to
try and:

-   [actually make a prioritised list of things I want to achieve at the
    beginning of the week]{#3c88}
-   [actually block out time in the calendar to work on them]{#b0d1}
-   [planning only for about 4--5 hours of real work per day]{#db66}
-   [ensuring I close email and slack periodically to reduce
    distraction]{#685d}
-   [grouping meetings and catchups together as much as possible (and
    have them earlier in the day)]{#c890}
-   [declining invites to things that aren't as important to me right
    now]{#3275}
-   [plan my train travel time to do things that are well suited to the
    train (like admin jobs, reading or writing articles ect)]{#52f8}

### Other stuff {#484f .graf .graf--h3 .graf-after--li name="484f"}

I started watching the rather strange
[Elle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3716530/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3716530/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} earlier this week which features
horrific sexual violence and disturbing behaviour by the protagonists
'friends'. I can't say it's enjoyable by any stretch and I've been
watching it in chunks as I've kind of lost interest, although feel a
strange compulsion to finish it so I know who did it.

I highly recommend the [West Wing
Weekly](http://thewestwingweekly.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://thewestwingweekly.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} for anyone with even a passing interest in the
show --- they're finally starting to review season 5 which co-host
Hrishi has never actually seen (he's a committed Sorkin-phile, who left
at the end of season 4).

More next week!
