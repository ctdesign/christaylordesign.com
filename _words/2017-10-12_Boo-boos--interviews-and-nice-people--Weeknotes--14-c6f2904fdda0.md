Sorry they're so late, things happened.

Some things we did last week:

-   [Mike planned more access needs and prototyping training and did
    lots of work around organising the design system]{#f8a6}
-   [He also updated the Centre of Excellence website in prep for the
    away day]{#38cc}
-   [We attended the Home Office DDaT away day]{#b8e3}
-   [Me and [Chris](https://twitter.com/wildsquirrelhub){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/wildsquirrelhub"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"} did *lots* of interviewing for
    Junior Interaction Designers]{#2503}
-   [I had a session with my mentor, Tim Paul from GDS]{#463e}
-   [I did lots of planning and sorting things out for the upcoming
    caseworking meetup]{#ca6a}

**Monday** began with a trip down to our Westminster office for the
first day of our Junior Interaction Designer Interviews, which I was
doing with my colleague (and Tom Hiddleston lookalike)
[Chris](https://twitter.com/wildsquirrelhub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/wildsquirrelhub"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. Part-way through my train journey, I
learned that I'd made, what we call in the profession, an unfortunate
boo-boo with the room booking. We'd sensibly reserved one room all day
for the interviews (three interviews of two hours each). However I had
neglected to plan for the fact that the fancy meeting rooms in this
office require you to check in on a tablet outside the room at the start
of the reservation. If you don't, the room is released for anyone else
in the building to book and I'd reserved the room from 9am.
Unfortunately I wouldn't be in the building till 10am. This resulted in
a few swift phone calls and running around by my colleagues to try and
get the room back, but someone else managed to snag a slot in the middle
of the day. Luckily, we were able to make some hasty alternative
arrangements. Lesson learned. The rest of the day went fine. Checking my
pedometer later on the day revealed I'd done about 3 miles of walking in
ferrying interview candidates around the building, which was a nice side
benefit.

**Tuesday** was spent at the Kia Oval (which probably would have been
more of a big deal for me if I was even mildly interested in cricket)
for our Digital, Data and Technology away day. I was helping host a
table where me and colleagues in our Centre of Excellence team would
have the chance to talk to attendees about some of the things we can
help delivery teams with. Lots of leaflets and postcards were handed out
and emails exchanged.

During the day, there was an announcement about exciting changes in the
Centre of Excellence. Previously we were technically four separate
things, but now we're going to be just one --- which makes much more
sense to everyone and reduces confusion about who you go to for what.
We're also going to be hiring two Senior Civil Servant roles to manage
the Centre, one of which will be responsible for User Centred Design
(the title is still being sorted out). This is a really exciting
development for us in the Home Office, as for the first time we will
have design representation at the board level.

MOJ's Chief Digital Officer Tom Read had a guest speaker slot, which I
particularly enjoyed. It's comforting to hear that the things we
struggle with in pursuing our digital agenda in the Home Office is not
unique to us.

I was back in Sheffield on **Wednesday** where we were interviewing
again. There's quite a bit of recruitment happening over the upcoming
few weeks and I spent a bit of time with Charles planning interviews and
speaking to one of our recruitment partners about another role. Felt
like for a long time there was nothing happening and then it's all
happened at once.

I also got in touch with some potential speakers for next weeks
caseworking meet up and made lots of todo lists and wrote up an initial
agenda, which I shared with the team of people helping me out.

I spent most of **Thursday** with the effortlessly pleasant Tim Paul
from GDS. Me and Tim nattered for a while about mentoring stuff and he
attended our regular Design Patterns working group meeting, to see how
we plan and organise our work. I take for granted sometimes how engaged
our designers are in the Home Office around helping each other. It's no
less amazing just because it is common.

We had one more interview on **Friday** and me and Chris spent a good
chunk of the afternoon reviewing all of the candidates and writing
feedback.

I also attended the weekly cross gov Design Systems call where I updated
everyone on the meet up next week.

More soon.
