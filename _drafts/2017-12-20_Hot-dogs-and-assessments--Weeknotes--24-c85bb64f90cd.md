Some things we did this week:

-   [Mike finished our prototype to test the things in the design system
    and planned testing]
-   [He also co-facilitated two prototyping kit training
    sessions]
-   [And did a health check on our visa services]
-   [Attended cross-gov design system workshop]
-   [Added new design pattern for
    [support](https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns/support){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor
    data-href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns/support"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"}]
-   [I attended an Extended Leadership Team meeting]
-   [Did another service assessment]
-   [Lots of recruitment and performance feedback stuff]

I spent most of **Monday** in London. Whilst on the train, I finished my
feedback for an assessment I attended last week. The train was delayed
due to the pretty but troublesome snow, resulting in me barely making my
team meeting on time.

In the afternoon I headed over to our second Extended Leadership Team
Meeting. This group consists of managers from all over DDaT, whose
purpose is to bubble up issues from their staff and help fix things. The
idea for this group is sound but we don't yet have a sense of ownership
over it yet, a point that I raised with the hosts. The next one will be
a practical un-conference where we'll come along with problems and
figure out ways to solve them. I'm looking forward to this --- I'm keen
to get *something* done.

After that I headed over to Victoria to meet the rest of the user
research and design team for a xmas get together. I was very excited
about the cute little pub dog that curled up next to a fire.

design systems workshop. GDS have been working on a shared backlog of
components and patterns across government department and wanted to use
this session to validate their work so far.

I was back in Sheffield on **Tuesday.** I spent the morning scoring a
supplier assessment. I managed to a play around with some prototyping
for a project I'm helping out with. I managed to get a load of data
displayed using YAML data, which should make what I want to do a lot
quicker to manage and maintain.

We had our new interaction design intern
[Alex](https://twitter.com/alexgadsby){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://twitter.com/alexgadsby" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} join us this week so I went through a few induction-y
things with her.

I spent a chunk of **Wednesday** in London again to sit on another panel
for an internal service assessment. We managed to finish a bit earlier
which I appreciated as its around three hours to get back home from
Croydon. I drafted an internal blog post about the Home Office design
system on the way back.

It's the season for our quarterly performance reviews this month. I
spent **Thursday** morning doing my self assessment and reviewing my
line reportees.

I was glad I was able to dedicate some time to work on the outputs and
plans for the caseworking patterns work. I've struggled to get round to
working on this over the last few month, which is making me feel really
bad. I'm hoping that whilst its quiet over Christmas I can make some
real progress on this.

I carried on working on this on **Friday** morning as well. I reviewed
my weekly to-dos and planned for next week. A good chunk of the day
seemed to on responding to emails, slack messaged and small admin jobs.
Attended the weekly cross gov design systems meeting in the afternoon.
