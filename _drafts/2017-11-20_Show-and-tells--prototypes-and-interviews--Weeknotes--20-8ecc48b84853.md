Some things we did this week:

-   [Mike attended the cross-gov design meetup in Edinburgh]
-   [He also finished his prototype for testing design patterns]
-   [We both did a design system show and tell]
-   [I did some phone interviews]
-   [Mike did a discovery assessment for an Immigration project]

**Monday** began with an eye-wateringly early start, as I was dropping
off my wife at the train station for 6:15. Due to the hour, I easily
breezed into the office afterwards, arriving before 7. I was
anticipating loosing all cognitive function by around 10ish, but to my
surprise I stayed pretty awake all day. I managed to work through quite
a few things before most people got in to the office, including my
design feedback of the previous weeks mock assessment.

Throughout the morning I had catchups with various team members and
colleagues. I've bunched these all together now and it's working much
better for me.

In the afternoon I continued with some management training via an online
platform we're trialling. I attended our regular user research and
design meet-up via phone to hear more about the work that the service
design team are doing. Over in Edinburgh,
[Mike](https://medium.com/@1mikeowen){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://medium.com/@1mikeowen" target="_blank"} was
representing the Home Office at the cross-government design meet up,
giving our departmental update in the Heads of Design section.

I spent all of **Tuesday** down in Croydon. On the train I prepped for a
show and tell that me and Mike had planned on the Home Office design
system. We were very keen that non designers came to it and had roped in
the design team to drag along their delivery team colleagues. It seemed
to go pretty well with a good turn out.

Some colleagues from GDS also came along to hear and we met with them
afterwards to discuss some research they are doing on the cross gov
design system. I also went to another show and tell for a team working
on end-to-end services in immigration. We had a chat afterwards to plan
a design sprint in a few weeks to look at a way to help measure outcomes
in end to end services. Ended up being a really busy but productive day.

On **Wednesday** I did some proper design work for a change --- I was
asked to help a team make a quick prototype for caseworking system. I
enjoyed that. I also fed back around the progress of some work I've been
involved in with our Comms team, which sounds like some positive
progress has been made. \

I had a catchup with
[Charles](https://medium.com/@charlesrt){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://medium.com/@charlesrt"
target="_blank"} to do a bit of a handover for his upcoming leave. In
the afternoon I attended a very interesting session about Biometrics and
the different ways its used in law enforcement and around the Home
Office I hadn't realised how heavily regulated it was and the different
methods there were available.

I spent **Thursday** morning prepping and remotely taking part in some
interviews --- not an ideal interview method, but it worked ok. Later on
in the day, I held a 1--2--1 with a staff member in the afternoon and
started planning the agenda for the design sprint, but didn't get very
far.

**Friday** went blazingly fast. I did my weekly review of my todo
list --- this was massively helpful as it turned out I forgot about a
bunch of small things (but thankfully remembered to record them). We had
our weekly team meeting and in the afternoon Charles held an impromptu
showing of a documentary about Design disruption. I went to the weekly
cross gov design patterns meeting where I updated everyone on what we've
been up to this week and my plans following the case working meet-up.
I'll be sharing details of this very soon.

More next week!
