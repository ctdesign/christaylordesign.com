This week we have been mostly winning at:

-   [interviewing senior interaction designers]
-   [arranging to visit projects to learn about what's working]
-   [publishing guidance around prototyping]
-   [improving the snippet code in our design system]

The week began with a handover meeting with my boss,
[Katy](https://twitter.com/katyarnie){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://twitter.com/katyarnie" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}. She's temporarily relieving herself of the joy of
looking after the research and design teams in favour of spending time
with her baby. I feel like we have helped prepare her well for this.

There was some welcome news about our new Head of Interaction Design who
will be starting with us next year --- more excitingly they will be
based up in Sheffield with me. Possibly not as exciting for them, but
good for me.

On **Monday** afternoon I spent an enjoyable few hours on an 'Essentials
of leadership' training course at Aviation House. The facilitators
taught us about how to apply our design approach to within our
organisations by researching and understanding the problem properly. We
also learned about the importance of dropping purism in favour of
looking for any opportunity for an opening with senior people. There
were many, many useful take aways --- highly recommend.

I caught up with the senior interaction designers about various bits on
**Tuesday** morning. The afternoon was interesting. A few weeks ago, at
our away day, our big boss announced the formation of an Extended
Leadership Team. This would consist of managers of large teams and
professional communities and would feed into the SLT. There was some
concern that this would just add yet another tier to our already
over-stuffed hierarchy, but I was hopeful that it would be an
opportunity to positively influence the SLT more directly. This
afternoon was the kick-off session for it. I had to attend over the
phone which wasn't ideal, but there was an encouraging level of
enthusiasm for supporting each other. Hopefully some good will come of
this soon.

On **Wednesday** and **Thursday** I was in Croydon interviewing for our
Senior Interaction Designer vacancies. Due to the rather casual
relationship the train system has with time, we ended up pushing one of
the interviews back --- which I hate to do. The next few days were
enjoyably spent with the splendidly faced
[Charles](https://medium.com/@charlesrt){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://medium.com/@charlesrt"
target="_blank"}. We even had a little date to see Blade Runner 2049 on
Weds night, which we're both not still entirely sure we enjoyed or not.
There were lots of things we liked, but the motivations of some of the
characters did not make a lot of sense to me. Still thinking about it a
week later though.

On **Friday** we had one more interview. We're doing a final set of
interviews next week and then I'm done with recruiting for a little
while. Don't get me wrong, hiring people is one of the most important
things we do but I will gladly welcome the change in rhythm --- they can
be quite intensive. I had a meeting with
[Mike](https://medium.com/@1mikeowen){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://medium.com/@1mikeowen" target="_blank"} and David in
the afternoon to chat about our ideas for researching our design system.
We're going to try building a fake service, consisting of patterns and
components that we want test and put that in front of users. I'm looking
forward to seeing the results.

Me and Mike talked a bit this week about how we both sometimes have days
where we don't have a lot to show for our time. Days can easily
disappear due to the accumulation of lots of small activities --- like
admin and helping colleagues --- with seemingly little to reflect on.

I think it's easy to forget that some of the bigger, more impactful
things we do are made up of lots of small steps. We also underestimate
the time planning takes and the importance that those ad hoc jobs or
chats with colleagues have in building good working relationships.

We are given a certain amount of freedom in how we approach things here,
which is both amazing and occasionally daunting, causing you to second
guess yourself constantly about whether you've used your time
effectively. I find myself often worrying about the worth of smaller,
easier jobs I do (which give me a sense of achievement) instead of
chipping away at the bigger real problems. It's a constant tension.
We're going to try and measure some of the things we do a bit better and
also get feedback from others, to help with this.

But maybe we should also just give ourselves a break.

More next week.
