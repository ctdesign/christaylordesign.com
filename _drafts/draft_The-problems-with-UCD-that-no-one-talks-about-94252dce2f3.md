### The problems with UCD that no-one talks about 

Pragmatism over time can feel more like a retreat. 

Not sure whether big bold change works better than quietly working away
over a long time

If you want to be in a leadership role in large organisations you need
to commit to a decent innings. 

As a community we focus way too much on technical skills

User-research gets put on a pedalstal but its not the only way to gain
insigh

\

I've worked in the Civil Service as an interaction designer for nearly
three years now. I work in a large government department with many
thoughtful and passionate people working to make government services
better for everyone. I genuinely enjoy it. Most of my time here has been
in leadership and management positions but I still get opportunities to
do some proper design work regularly.

I think I'm quite an optimistic person, but pragmatically so. I look for
the best intentions. I generally believe that people are trying to do
the right thing. But I'm not naive. I know some of how the world works.
I come from a working class family, my mum a housewife and my dad a
bricklayer. I grew up in ex-mining town in the East Midlands on a
council estate. That might conjure up particular images for you, but it
was nice. I didn't know any different. We always had things we needed.
There were some tough times, but probably no different to most families.

I think that we should make things better for right now, over trying to
create an imagined perfection way off in the future. 

*Caveat --- this is my own thoughts and experience. You may have had
different experience which is fine, I in no way discount that. *

#### People make or break my enjoyment of work 

Working with like minded people is one of the best thing about my job.
The feeling that you're all working towards something better,
complimenting each others skills etc is great.

But people with power over you can really make life hard. And it can be
really fucking exhausting. You consider avoiding them to stay away from
confrontation. 

#### It might be more valuable to teach 'soft' skills over improving technical ability 

\
- we don't really educate people well on the civil service and how
government works\
- we don't explain we'll how decisions are made and how spend control
works\
- we don't help people present to senior people, give tips on getting
senior buy in or how to present to boards\
- there's a whole swathe of 'soft-skills' that are essential to making
things land. We've got loads of this experience over gov --- we should
be sharing this

Our digital profession lives in a bubble\
- we have the right attitude and approach but often fail to make it
land\
- we need to move past the phase of seeing ourselves as special or
different\
- there's two tiers of digital --- technology and digital and none are
right. The next step surely needs to be integration with operations and
policy\
- we can be snide about people we butt up against. I do this sometimes,
it's a bad habit bourne out of frustration. \
We sometimes celebrate very insular things, milestones that don't mean
much, or write blog posts on things I don't feel are important. I think
it's be nice to see a blend of things\
- we need a reality check

We need to be more honest\
- people leave when expectations don't meet reality \
- I worry that overly positive blog posts are harmful overall and cover
up the real problems we have

I feel like I'm not a real designer sometimes because I don't
necessarily share the outlook of other designers \
- I get a lot of satisfaction from working in public sector and from
helping users \
- but I get more of a satisfaction from solving problems. A lot of tr
things I do don't directly affect end users --- I manage a team, I help
set strategic direction with my peers, --- so I think this is actually a
good fit for me. \
- but I worry that we are projecting almost a moral test implicitly in
our public discussions. I groan when I see things like "it's not about
x, its about doing x' --- this should probably be a meme. Its not like 

#### We are too dismissive of things that don't meet our imaginary high standards 

I've seen a snobbishness about some gig services that lots of good
people have worked on. We have to remember that we are here to enact the
policies of the government of the day. If you don't like that then you
shouldn't be a civil servant. By all means questions things and bring
your self to work. But the civil service performs an important function
in government. 

#### I'm not sure that we're working coherently towards anything anymore 

Government exists, like many organisations, in a state of contradiction.
At the same time you have teams looking at how to best use machine
learning and automation, but in the same department you will have quite
important systems that rely on a macro that someone made for excel.

\
- lots of digital government has become much more everyday\
- early days of GDs we're about disruption and carving a path for the
new way. But we're still in a position where departments are making bad
technology decisions just like 10 years ago. That doesn't mean that the
mission of GDS has failed

Our ways of working are still not understood well enough:\
- I still need to explain to seasoned technology professionals why we
work the way we do. Thats fine, that's my job. \
- 

Working in the open helps\
- I was at a conference where my colleague was warmly greeted by lots of
people she had visited 

What I think I need to make it easier to do my work;\
- senior support and clout\
- fixing the basics --- it's still too hard to buy things, get equipment
that people need to do their job
