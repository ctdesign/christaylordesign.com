### Managing people 

I've noticed that as a result of the emphasis that we put on technical
and digital skills is that it's easy to forget that all of these
wonderful people need supporting, nurturing and managing. 

Management can, let's be honest, be a bit of a dirty word. It's
certainly viewed with distain by some--- mostly because we all have
lived through examples of when its been done badly. 

But, I've always been surprised how some people view it as an
*annoyance*, that they have to manage people. Like it's an inconvenience
or distraction from someone's *proper* job. 

I've genuinely found it rewarding to *look after* people. 

 in my immediate line management chain and more widely as Head of
community of over 300 practitioners. Government can be a bewildering and
strange version of reality so I see being there for people as the main
part of my job (more on what I do as a Head of UCD here). 

Being visible and approachable

Its their time, prioritise it.

Frequency

Ask for their input into agenda

Approach with coaching mindset 

but recognise when it can be more helpful to help them more directly
navigate the organisation 

Dig a bit deeper. 

\

Make notes!

Record actions (who will do what)

Bring up any behavioural or performance issues

Having akward chats

I like to script these beforehand. 

Prompts to help:

-   [Is there anything frustrating you or bothering you at work at the
    moment?]
