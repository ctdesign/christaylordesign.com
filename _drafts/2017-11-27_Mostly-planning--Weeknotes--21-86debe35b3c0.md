20 Nov--24 Nov 17

Some things we achieved this week:

-   [Me and Mike participated in some design crits]
-   [Mike [released a new version of the design
    system](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/design-system/releases/tag/1.3.0){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor
    data-href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/design-system/releases/tag/1.3.0"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"} including updated guidance and code
    fixes and we both did another show and tell]
-   [I did a pre-assessment visit to a Border Force digital team]
-   [Interviewed for contract designers]
-   [Lots of planning for upcoming things]

I'm sat here on a Sunday morning, with West Wing on in the background,
still a bit perturbed that the week went by so fast. There was, shall we
say, a lot of familial related shenanigans to deal with this week for
which I was glad for a relatively (pun mildly intended) light weekend.
Looking back, on paper it doesn't look like I've done as much as I
*felt* I did. I have to keep reminding myself that it's quality not
quantity.

**Monday** morning was spent doing my regular round of catch-ups and
stand-ups with colleagues. Much of today was about doing lots of little
jobs --- moving desks, responding to emails, booking rooms etc. It felt
satisfying getting lots of small things off my to-do list. In the
afternoon I remotely took part in a design crit in Croydon. I'm really
pleased we've got a regular cycle of these going on now.

On **Tuesday** I send out an initial agenda for a design sprint I'm
facilitating next week. Really looking forward to doing this.
[Charles](https://medium.com/@charlesrt){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://medium.com/@charlesrt"

fit in just 4 days, instead of the standard 5. In September [I went on
facilitation
training](https://weeknot.es/weeknotes-9-design-sprints-2e676e0218fe){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://weeknot.es/weeknotes-9-design-sprints-2e676e0218fe"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and this the first one I've run since
then. I ran through my notes from the day and spent a bit of time
reading various articles to get all of the activities clear in my head.
The articles and videos from [AJ&
Smart](https://blog.ajsmart.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://blog.ajsmart.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in
particular were really helpful. I underestimated the amount of planning
and reading I needed to do for this --- but the materials I've put
together should serve as a good template for future sprints.

In the afternoon I did a phone interview.
[Sam](https://medium.com/@samwake){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://medium.com/@samwake" target="_blank"} arranged a
design crit in the Sheffield office, so I went along --- much better to
do in person.

I was in London all day on **Wednesday**. I had a 1--2--1 with Lynne in
the morning. Also had a good chat with Rosanna about some upcoming
service assessments and the support we can give to teams.

I was primarily there to meet with a team working on a case working
system in Border Force, in order to talk about the help that we in the
central team can provide. A very interesting project. We need to look
into making sure more teams are aware of the work and support that we
can provide in the central team. In the afternoon I went over to Clive
House with Mike to do another Show and Tell on the Design System.

**On Thursday** morning I helped out with some work our internship
programme --- we wanted to add a events section to the [Home Office
blog](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} to promote upcoming open days in London and Sheffield.

I reviewed a draft blog post from
[Karwai](https://medium.com/@krwpn){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://medium.com/@krwpn" target="_blank"} and spent some of
the afternoon making notes about the design sprint. Following my meeting
with the project team yesterday, I sent over a bunch of resources to the
designer I met and introduced him to others who can provide him with
some support.

Most of **Friday** I spent writing out a detailed list of what I'm
actually doing in the design sprint next week and organised all of my
supplies and things I'll need. I try to be quite detailed in my planning
and tend to write a lot of it out in longhand --- it helps me think
through everything properly. The room we've got secured isn't perfectly
ideal but it has plenty of wall space.

Next week I'll share my design sprint agenda, checklist and write a blog
post about how it went.
