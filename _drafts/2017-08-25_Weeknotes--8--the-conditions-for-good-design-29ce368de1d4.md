Things we achieved this week:

-   [Published a blog on [how I ran my first design meet
    up](https://medium.com/@ctdesign/how-i-ran-my-first-meet-up-7c9bc427ded6){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor
    data-href="https://medium.com/@ctdesign/how-i-ran-my-first-meet-up-7c9bc427ded6"
    target="_blank"}]
-   [Completed first draft of an interaction design health check]
-   [More testing on the central centre of excellence website]
-   [Eliot published a blog post on [icons in design
    systems](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/08/18/good-icons-should-be-invisible/){.markup--anchor

It's been another relatively quiet week, as everyone but me seems to be
on holiday somewhere. Probably sunny. Not that I'm bitter.

On Monday, I was able to do a short presentation on the [Home Office
Design
System](https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} to the collective user research, design
and content team. I'm trying to spread the word about the resource as
much as possible, as we continue to research and iterate on patterns and
components.

We also had a good interaction design team meeting (well, I found it
useful). We ran a session with one of our delivery managers to discuss
issues around how design fits into delivery. Some of the common problem
designers come across, included:

-   [not having enough time to implement user-led improvements]
-   [solutions being defined before design is involved]
-   [not having enough time to research and iterate]
-   [the pressure to 'feed' developers]
-   [design being forced into a very development heavy delivery
    process]

The session really helped everyone understand that, particularly in the
alpha phase, the delivery should be organised around research and design
as that is the dominant activity. We also need ensure that we take
opportunities to push back on decisions. We sometimes aren't great at
running alpha's in the Home Office --- the pressure to deliver means not
enough time is given to try different ideas. But alphas are the cheap
phase of the project, where learning should be prioritised. The session
also brought home that we need to get better at using evidence to back
up our decisions.

We're also going to experiment with changing the format of our team
meetings, from next week. It's great that we can all get together every
two weeks but attendance for some is difficult as our designers are
spread over central London, Croydon and Sheffield. We're going to try
having a weekly remote meeting instead, which will consist of a round
table of updates and some short show and tells. My hope is that it will
encourage more collaboration and also help everyone understand what they
are working on better.

On Tuesday and Wednesday we were visited by our two successful intern
candidates. They will both be based in our Sheffield office, so I had a
chance to show them around and give them an overview of the kinds of
things we are working on there. We're very lucky to have them and I'm
really looking forward to see them get stuck in.

I spent a bit of time this week writing some documentation with
[Charles](https://twitter.com/charles_rt){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/charles_rt"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} to help teams understand what good
design looks like (on a screen so bright, we had to switch to dark
mode --- which coincidently was [a subject he also blogged about this
week](https://hackernoon.com/apple-and-others-need-a-dark-mode-for-people-like-molly-watt-ae9fdc38479f){.markup--anchor

As part of this I created a draft of an 'Interaction Design Health
Check' --- a questionnaire that will hopefully help me understand the
areas that I can support teams with. It asks questions around good
practice and behaviours we think help ensure good design thrives on
projects. I've tested it with two designers so far and I think it will
be useful. It's also been great to have some really good discussions
around defining what good interaction design practice looks like and
coming up with ways to try evidence it. When it's a bit more refined
I'll share this.

[As promised last
week](https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes-7-mentoring-and-gov-design-sheffield-2f1de29cffee){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes-7-mentoring-and-gov-design-sheffield-2f1de29cffee"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, I published a blog post on [how I ran
the Gov Design Sheffield
meet-up](https://medium.com/@ctdesign/how-i-ran-my-first-meet-up-7c9bc427ded6){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://medium.com/@ctdesign/how-i-ran-my-first-meet-up-7c9bc427ded6"
target="_blank"}. I learned loads from the event and read some useful
articles in prep, so I wanted to get it all down in the hope that it
might be useful to someone else. Accompanying this, I published a
[meet-up checklist on
github](https://github.com/ctdesign/meetup-checklist){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://github.com/ctdesign/meetup-checklist" rel="noopener"

important stuff next time round. Feel free to add to it with anything
else you can think of.

I had a good conversation on Thursday with someone from GDS, feeding
back about their design training and talking about ideas for things they
could offer in the future. I think for interaction designers (but
probably most people in digital), it would be really useful to have some
training around how government departments actually work. I admit that
there is lots about the structures of the Home Office that I just don't
know and I think it would be so helpful to get an insight into the
decision making processes and governance systems in place. A lot of this
stuff you do find out on the job but the relationships between different
panels and groups is a little unclear unless you've had a lot of
experience here.

We now have a date and venue confirmed for my [designing case-working
systems
meet-up](https://attending.io/events/designing-case-working-systems){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://attending.io/events/designing-case-working-systems"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.
[Alice](https://twitter.com/AliceNoakes){.markup--anchor

[Joe](https://twitter.com/joelanman){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor

chat through ideas for the agenda and activities on the day --- we're
still working on this but will share with everyone who has signed up
soon.

If you work in government and you're designing a case-working system,
maybe you'd like to come along, sign-up here:
