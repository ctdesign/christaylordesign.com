Sorry, late again.

But I had a pretty good week all in all. Really felt like I made some
good progress on two projects I'm working on.

### **Highlights of the week** 

#### **Beginning to turn research into the fun stuff**

I spent most of Monday and Tuesday voluntarily locked in a room (albeit
with some fine people) to finalise our discovery on decision making in
Home Office Policing.

By now we've interviewed nine people who are involved at various levels
of decision making and this session was for us to sharing the insights
with everyone in the team and agree on a set of findings.

As part of the interviews, the team had already helpfully logged key
insights on a spreadsheet (with references that pointed to the original
raw data) so we read through these excerpts, made notes on post-its and
put them on the wall. We then began sorting and grouping, which helped
us see patterns that we didn't previously know of.

After we'd done that we started with the fun stuff --- coming up with
some actual ideas.

We began by reviewing the discovery goals and our assumptions and
discussed which ones we had proved or disproved. It was clear that some
of the assumptions were only going to be tested by actually building
something.

Without worrying about a particular structure, we then individually
reviewed the pain points on the walls and our map of the decision making
process and noted ideas on post-its.

I found it helpful to write some '[how might
we](http://www.designkit.org/methods/3){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="http://www.designkit.org/methods/3"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}' questions to prompt ideas --- in
retrospect I probably should have started with these as it really helped
direct my thinking but by the end we'd generate lots of ideas.

We're going to run a dedicated workshop session next week to further
develop these ideas, critique them and come up with some new ones. I'm
glad we're spending some time on this as I think it can be really easy
to rush this step. I think that some of the way we talk about research
makes it seem that alpha ideas can sometimes emerge as these inevitable,
obvious things that research has directed you towards.

We used [Will Myddletons excellent
articles](http://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-run-better-discoveries){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-run-better-discoveries"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} to help us frame and plan our discovery.
One of the things I liked was having a list of definitions of done for
the discovery, which have been really useful in keeping us on track.
This has really helped as we've been doing research as a team, sometimes
without a dedicated user researcher.

#### **Getting people on board with a new design** 

On another non-public facing project I'm working on, we have iterated on
the previous visual design and layout to make the service simpler and
clearer. I've spent a bit of time removing visual elements that users
reported as confusing and taking away things that cluttered up the page
(and trialing some new visual design standards we're developing in the
Home Office).\
 \
But as the previous design had been in place for several months I knew I
needed to proactively talk with some of the senior stakeholders to
explain the rationale behind the changes. I didn't really know them
particularly well and wanted to make sure that they felt involved in the
thinking behind the changes we wanted to introduce.

Luckily, it went great. Talking about the feedback from previous rounds
of user testing helped [motivate their
elephant](https://weeknot.es/prioritising-projects-and-prototyping-weeknotes-s02e05-6a85ab4d8a5a){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://weeknot.es/prioritising-projects-and-prototyping-weeknotes-s02e05-6a85ab4d8a5a"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. It helped that the product manager and
some of our developers were also on hand to support the changes and
reassure about the technical impact--- it's so important to have your
team on board before trying to engage with the wider programme (also
social proof helps).

#### Other stuff 

I missed Deadpool 2 at the cinema so was looking forward to watching it
on home release. I thought it was ok, not as good as the original. For
me it was trying a bit too hard to out-joke the first one.

I spent a lot of the weekend painting doors and fixing things around the
house which gave me a warm sense of achievement but left me pretty
tired. Looking forward to a camping trip in Wales in a couple of weeks.

More next week!
