### What does a Head of UCD do? 

\

What I thought my role was...

What you do is highly dependant on structurally where you are in the
organisation. 

We've actually got a lot of things in place. 

Task wise --- its a lot of meetings and answering queries

Oneof the issues with how we are organisaed in Home Office is there's 

But a big part of my role is hard to account for or measure. Helping
people navigate and understand the organisation is a big part of it. I
see a lot of poeple who come into the organisation who might assume that
because of our size and what they've heard about GDS that the 'fight' is
over, and its this quasi-utopia where projects are done 'right'
(whatever that means).

Thats not the case --- nor will it ever be. The biggest underdeveloped
(and valued) skill that UCD people need it constantly advocating for
UCD --- their roles and the value. I'd take a designer who can sell the
value of their work over a more technically competent designer who was
not a strong communicater any day. 

My job is to look ahead, anticipate problems

You have to get comfortable on truly delegating and letting other people
decide on how they do something. Its so temping to get into the detail
but you must leave people to it. Its kind of similar to coaching someone
versus telling them the answer. 

I often descibe the work as gently poking pebelles
downhill --- selecting and poking with the right amount of force which
will result in bigger impact donn the road, but you can really only
choose which ones and --- teh rest is up to someone else.
