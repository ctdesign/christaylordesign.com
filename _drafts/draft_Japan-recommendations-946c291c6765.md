### Japan recommendations 

Hotel wise, we stopped in;\
- Tokyo: Miyako City Tokyo Takanawa. This is less than 10 mins walk from
Shinagawa station (which is also a Shinkansen station and only 20 mins
from Haneda airport). Shinagawa is also on the the Yamanote loop
line --- basically a circle line around Tokyo where you can get to a lot
of the stops. We chose it for price and convenience. We paid for a king
room, to get a slightly bigger room, but it was still small by UK
standards. It was about £112 per night, so not bad really (also included
breakfast)\
-Kyoto: Sakura Terrace The Gallery. This was nice as the room was a
Deluxe King with Balcony --- really good sized, had a sofa in it as
well, plenty of room. You also got a complementary drink per person
every night you were there. Also has a Gym and onsen. This was also 5
mins from Kyoto station, so easy to find and then get around and do
stuff in Kyoto. This was about £125 per night. Worth it tho, some nights
we just got some beers from the 7/11 and sat on the balcony. \
- Osaka: Hilton Osaka. Went a bit posh here, mostly because prices and
availability was affected by the G7 that was in town around the same
time. So this ended up being abouy £190 per nigh, but it was a king
room, decent size and we had a nice view out of the 27th floor. Also 5
mins from the station. Would recommend, but you'll hopefully be able to
find somewhere cheaper.

Here's some of the stuff we did:\
Tokyo:\
- Visited Meiji Shrine --- worth doing on a sunny day, very pretty\
- Went to Shibuya crossing --- walked over the crossing, had dinner in
observation tower near by. \
- Shibuya Sky Tower --- this was good, but it was raining so the open
air floor was closed, but worth doing. You need to book a ticket for
this and its timed. Theres plenty of other observation areas in Tokyo
tho, so its not essential. \
- Did a day trip to Fuji. We took a train to an area called Kawaguchiko
(took a few hours and a couple of trains), but theres a lake there with
a gondola to go up and get a view of Fuji and a few other walks. Theres
a sightseeing bus (The Kawaguchiko Sight Seeing Bus) that stops at loads
of interesting places. It worth checking the weather beforehand, then
going when its clear, as Fuji is notorious for being clouded (it was
when we were there, but then we got a good view and photo from the
bullet train on the last day). \
- Visited the Imperial Palace --- just walked around which was nice. The
tours get really busy and have to be booked in advance.\
- Walked around the nerdy Akihabara area. This has got loads of manga
and anime stuff, but also weird maid cafes. Full of blokes who look like
me (but more unwashed). Cool tho. \
- Walked around Asakusa --- this is a big shrine and market --- would
recommend this, we ate there and looked around all the little stalls, it
was fun but really busy (we were there on a sunday)\
- Walked around Ginza district. This was cool, its a posh area for
shopping. Went to the flagship Muji store (about 10 floors including a
hotel) and this cool stationary store called Itoya. \
- Drinks at New York Bar in The Hyatt. This is the bar featured in Lost
in Translation. Its a pain in the arse to find (the hotel is on the
47--52 floors or something, but the way you get up to isnt
straightforward, so look it up before you go). But this was one of my
favourite things, an amazing view of the city and a jazz band playing.

Kyoto\
- Walked around traditional Gion district. This was interesting, saw
loads of Geishas. \
- Went to International Manga Museum. Good for a couple of hours.\
- Visited Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. To be honest we wouldnt do this
again, it was really touristy --- noisy and busy. If you get there early
you can avoid crowds. Theres other bamboo groves you can find. \
- Visited the olden Pavilion --- a golden temple in a pretty
garden --- this was much more peaceful. \
- Went to Nara Park. You can go here from Kyoto or Osaka, its about the
same distance. Lots of deer who bow to you for food. Probably avoid the
weekend here. There a massive temple with this huge budda state in it
which is cool. \
- Kyoto impperial palace was really quiet when we were there, which was
nice. \
- Fushimi Inari Shrine --- this has a walking route up a nearby hill
with thousands on small red tori gates that you pass through. Again, go
early to avoid crowds and tedious tiktokers. \
Osaka:\
- Floating garden observatory --- this was another observation tower but
he building was so cool it was worth it. We just paid on the day. \
- Eat in Dotonbori --- this is a bustling food and drink area by the
river. Its a bit mad but was one of my favourite things. \
- Osaka Castle --- I just walked around the outside, but you can queue
to get in.

Hiroshima:\
- We went to the Museum and the Itsukushima Shrine on Miyajima island.
Did it all in 1 day and travelled to here from Osaka on the bullet
train. Worth doing, but it can be upsetting in the Museum.

Overall its great. You definitely need to take plenty of cash, but a few
of the restaurants we went to and 7/11 convenience stores took card. We
took about 75% of our money in cash and the rest on one of those post
office travel money cards.

You definitely want to hire a wifi dongle so you can use google maps to
figure out the subways.

We bought a 14-day JR pass as we were travelling around so
much --- which was definitely worth it. You need to read up about these
before hand though as they work on most bullet trains, but only some
subways and local buses. There a good app called Japan Travel --- that
lets you journey plan but filter by what is compatible with the JR
Pass --- very handy as Google Maps doesn't do that.

Feel free to ask me any other questions!
