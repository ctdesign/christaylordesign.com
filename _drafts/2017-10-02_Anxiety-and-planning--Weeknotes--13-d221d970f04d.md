Some stuff we did over the past week:

-   [Mike ran another training session on prototyping and coding]
-   [He also did a very well received talk about anxiety]
-   [I wrote up and shared our goals for Interaction Design in the
    centre of excellence]
-   [We did an induction with one of our new interaction Design
    interns]
-   [I planned lots of things]

Following our planning the previous week, **Monday** began with setting
some of the things in motion. I wrote up the notes from the retro,
[updated our Trello
board](https://trello.com/b/OR5L8Vdt/pd-coe-interaction-design-tasks){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://trello.com/b/OR5L8Vdt/pd-coe-interaction-design-tasks"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and shared everything with the wider
team. We also used our regular Design Patterns working group meeting to
generate ideas around improving the Design Patterns. We really want to
get teams used to contributing back to them discussing the guidance
regularly.

On **Tuesday** I planned to do some prep for my Designing Caseworking
meet up, but I kept getting knocked off track with other things. It was
something that requires a bit of thought but I kept finding my mind
wandering or getting interrupted. I felt better later on in the week
after speaking to a few people about the agenda --- they helped me feel
confident that the talks and activities we have planned will be useful.

I also met with some of my colleagues in the central team to talk about
our departments' away day next week. There's going to be some exciting
announcements about things we've been waiting ages to get the go ahead
on. We're also using it as a bit of an opportunity to talk to more
delivery teams about what the central team can help with. We're setting
up a little stall to spread the word about our work and make some new
contacts. It's easy to forget sometimes how enormous the Home Office is
and the many levels in its hierarchy. I also find it really useful, as
I'm based in the North, to have the chance to bump into people I
wouldn't normally.

Most of **Wednesday** was spent with one of our new Interaction Design
Interns, doing induction stuff. I seemed to spend a large amount of it
apologising for the terrible systems we have for booking holiday and
finding out your entitlement to benefits. Although these are real
annoyances, I've been reminded recently of how lucky we are with the kit
we work on and the relative autonomy we have in our work. Its easy to
forget that fellow civil servants, sometimes on the other side of the
floor, are working on decades old equipment and have stringent rules
around what they do in their job. I think I would find that really hard.

I had a good talk with
[Maria](https://twitter.com/MariaWithDesign){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/MariaWithDesign"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} from MoJ about the case-working meet up
on **Thursday**. During our chat, she mentioned that some of her design
team colleagues are trialling buddying up with another designer for
regular feedback and critique about their work. We've found setting up
regular crits difficult, especially with such a distributed team over
several offices. Recently we've tended to have ad-hoc sessions in our
team meetings but I'm very keen to make this a more regular thing. So
we're going to steal this idea and see how it works for us.

Mike did a very well received talk on his experiences with anxiety. It's
a topic he has [written about
openly](https://medium.com/@1mikeowen/my-anxious-journey-ccd82807da92){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://medium.com/@1mikeowen/my-anxious-journey-ccd82807da92"
target="_blank"} before, which has really helped further my
understanding of the subject. Following [Gavin
Elliott's](https://medium.com/@gavinelliott){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://medium.com/@gavinelliott"
target="_blank"} recent grand tour of the UK to talk about Imposter
Syndrome and the great healthy discussion around mental health that it
has generated, it seemed like a good time to contribute to the
conversation, and I'm really pleased it'd gone down well.

I also spent a chunk of Thursday organising more upcoming recruitment.
Over the next few weeks I'm involved in *a lot* of interviewing and
sifting --- we're hiring for junior, intermediate, senior and lead
interaction designer roles. You wait ages for one bus...

I spent **Friday** morning on our performance management system
approving goals and some admin. I think goal setting is really important
but find the systems we use to manage these things rather tiresome. I
spent a good chunk of the afternoon prepping for three days of
interviews next week. I went out for a leaving lunch with some of the
Sheffield office, as our Agile savant
[Tom](https://twitter.com/thatagile?lang=en){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/thatagile?lang=en"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} is sadly leaving us to spread his gospel
elsewhere. He, and his plethora of tomato timers, will be missed.

I finished listening to an awesome book called
[Sapiens](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00K7ED54M/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00K7ED54M/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} this week which was utterly fascinating.
It talks about the origins of humans, how much our institutions and ways
of viewing society are mere figments of our shared imagination and what
humanity might develop into. Highly recommended, although I think I may
need to re-read it a few times to make it all stick.

More next week!
