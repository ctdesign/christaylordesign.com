Some things we did last week:

-   [Mike added some new patterns and updated guidance]
-   [He also published a new anxiety poster]
-   [And did a design review of a service]
-   [We both completed our summary of our Interaction Design Health
    checks with teams]
-   [I did some performance review work and held 1--2--1's and catchups
    with staff]
-   [Also interviewed for some contract designers]

Things seemed to pretty much be back to business as usual this week with
most people returning to work. I continued my attempts to help our new
Head of Interaction Design, Andrew, begin to get a vague sense of how
this place works. I was a bit scattered last week, mainly focussing on
lots of small jobs --- I need to ensure I carve out a big chunk of time
for my bigger tasks.

Me and Mike are intending to review the last few months of our work and
plan ahead with Andrew next week, once he's got a bit more of a footing
here. I'm very keen to try and work out ways to demonstrate the value of
Interaction Design in the Home Office going forward --- maybe some kind
of framework with supporting evidence that we maintain centrally. I hope
that this will underpin some of our future work around engaging with
senior managers in the Home Office and giving designers on delivery
teams ammunition for advocating for their work.

In the beginning of the week I spent some time making updates to a
couple of prototypes. I really like the variety I have in my job --- one
week I'll be running a workshop, another I'll be writing guidance and
sometimes I'll even be doing some proper design. It can be hard to know
you're making progress towards your overall goals when things change a
lot week-to-week but it's not boring.

Mike has been continuing his sterling work on the updating the [Home
Office design

awesome new anxiety poster to add to our existing suite of work around
accessibility

I spent a couple of days in London this week for meetings and
interviewing contractors. Interviewing is also a great opportunity to
get to know people on other teams --- I sometimes forget the importance
of this, especially when your office base is far away from the bulk of
our delivery teams.

I've got through a few audiobooks over the last few weeks --- I like
listening to them driving and when I'm working out. I finished La Belle
Sauvage last week which I thoroughly recommend for any fans of the His
Dark Materials trilogy. A wonderful and addictive read.

I also finally got round to Good Omens --- it was really funny and
witty, but I found the plot a bit meh.

I'm going to take a bit of break from writing weeknotes for a short
while --- I'll be back soon.
