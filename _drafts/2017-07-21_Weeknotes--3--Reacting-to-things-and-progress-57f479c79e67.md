layout: post

**Key things we achieved this week:**

-   [Mike finished prepping for new access needs training for
    interaction designers. Our first pilot session is next week.]
-   [Mike also organised some training designed for people who want to
    change code on live sites/prototypes but don't know how to.]
-   [Secured a venue and some speakers for a [gov design
    meetup](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sheffield-gov-design-meetup-tickets-36314345184){.markup--anchor

-   [Finished organising and planning content for upcoming
    interviews.]
-   [Spoke at a developer community meet-up about interaction
    design.]

This week I feel like I have mostly been reacting to things more than I
would have liked. I was also sent slightly mad after spending two hours
on Wednesday trying to book rooms for upcoming events and meeting.

*Two. Hours.*

Anyone who thinks it's a waste of time designing these kinds of internal
systems obviously hasn't had the misfortune to use them. It's easy to
forget the cumulative effect these annoyances can have on staff's day.

In our weekly central product design session, we learned the outcomes
from last weeks meeting with the senior leadership team. We had put
together a roadmap of activity for how we want to help set standards and
support delivery teams to build great services. There's a bit more work
to be done to refine our plans but we are hopeful to get an OK next
week, so that we can kick-start our engagement with the wider Digital,
Data and Technology organisation.

I had the chance to do a talk at the Home Office developers meet-up on
Thursday. It seemed to go well and there was some great discussion
afterwards. We spoke a bit about the work the dev team are doing with

rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and trying to make it a bit more usable
by designers. The potential is that it can be used in certain
circumstances for prototyping, which also makes it easier for developers
to implement. I see this approach as being particularly useful during
the beta phase of delivery so that designers, content and devs can work
more closely together, and more quickly.

On Friday I attended a weekly Gov Design System catchup where we share
our progress with building design systems across government. There is
some great work going on at DWP and HMRC and we all seem to be having
similar issues in terms of definitions for patterns and components and
getting the right kind of buy-in for using the systems. There's going be
a cross-government meetup on design systems again soon which I'm looking
forward to.

I'm also organising a Gov Design meetup in Sheffield. We had a good
response to the expression of interest that I mentioned in my [first
weeknotes](https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes-1-making-plans-recruitment-and-design-patterns-9b0521495493){.markup--anchor

data-href="https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes-1-making-plans-recruitment-and-design-patterns-9b0521495493"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, so it's going ahead. We've already
managed to secure a venue (thanks
[Rich](https://twitter.com/MachenRichard1){.markup--anchor

will be doing show and tells of their projects. More information and
