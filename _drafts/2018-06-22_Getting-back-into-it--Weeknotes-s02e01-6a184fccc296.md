### Getting back into it: Weeknotes s02e01 

Hello! I'm back from my weeknotes hiatus.

I'm working on some interesting stuff at the moment and I wanted to get
back into the habit of writing weeknotes to share what I'm doing and to
keep myself honest.

I'm stealing some of the good ideas I've seen from [fellow
weeknoters](https://weeknot.es/@dasbarrett){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://weeknot.es/@dasbarrett"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} for the format of my posts to keep it a
bit more relevant and manageable this time round.

### **Since we last spoke** 

I'm now working as a Design Lead within the Police Digital Service in
the Home Office. We're a small, multidisciplinary team that's supporting
some of the big Home Office policing programmes to be more agile and
user-centred.

I'm spread over a strategy team and a delivery team. The main things I'm
specifically doing are:

-   [working to improve the adoption of user centred design within
    policing programmes]
-   [helping to hire more designers and support the practice of
    interaction design]
-   [actually working as a designer on a project.]

I'm really enjoying working here. I'm spending a lot of the week in
London, but the people I work with are awesome and we have a really good
shared understanding of what our purpose is, following several sessions
to define our collective objectives and key results. Crucially this was
done by all of the team, but also involved the Service Manager and
Senior Responsible Officer signing off on it.

### **Things that happened thing week** 

#### **Co-designing with Hackney Council** 

Myself and some colleagues went to a session at Hackney Council
facilitated by [We are
Snook](https://twitter.com/wearesnook){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://twitter.com/wearesnook" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} to help co-design an open research library after
[Zuz](https://twitter.com/techforevil?lang=en){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/techforevil?lang=en"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} spotted this shout out on Twitter from
[Matthew Cain](https://medium.com/@mcaino){.markup--anchor

This was pleasantly fortuitous, as we've also started a similar project,
so we jumped at the chance to get involved.

It was great to hear about some of the approaches they were thinking
about and the problems they were trying to solve. We shared some of our
thinking and some things that the wider Home Office user research team
have tried before. We're going to continue talking to each other about
this and share our learnings.

#### A good project kick-off 

We also had a great kick-off of our own research library project. Our
current focus is to understand how key people in the Home Office arrive
at their decisions. We think that the research our wider team has done
over the last year will be useful to these groups, but we want to
understand more about their needs first. It was nice to work from the
lovely atrium at MOJ Petty France, especially since our fire alarm went
off and it took ages to get back into our building.

#### A quarterly retro and planning 

I'm also part of a strategy team here and we spent Friday reviewing and
planning for the next 3 months of work for the whole team. In
particular, we has a really good retro. I think I need to deliberately
do less in order to feel like I'm making progress towards the important
things. It was good to see that my colleagues we also raising similar
positive and negative things --- a good indicator that we're aligned in
the right way.

### **What I learned this week** 

It was great to hear about other people trying to solve similar problems
to us at the Hackney session but the willingness and eagerness to invite
feedback and ideas struck me as something to make sure that we continue
to celebrate as an industry. When you're surrounded by people who think
like this, it's easy to assume and expect it, but it does take a
conscious effort. I think we should make sure that we continue to
encourage this and show the benefits of working in the open.

### **Other stuff** 

I've enjoyed listening to a podcast about Game developers called Tone
Control. I'm also a big fan of the Empire movie podcast and West Wing
Weekly. I don't really like to listen to any design podcasts for some
reason.

I just downloaded a new audiobook called the Righteous Mind: Why Good
People are Divided by Politics and Religion which I'm led to believe is
very good. I was listening to a sci-fi book called the Three-Body
Problem, but to be honest found it a bit boring so I abandoned ir. Up
until very recently I would have persisted out of some compulsion to
finish what I started, but I'm now more thinking that books shouldn't be
a chore and to trust my gut with things like this.

More next week!
