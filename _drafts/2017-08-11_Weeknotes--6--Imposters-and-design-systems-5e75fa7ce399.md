Key things we achieved this week:

-   [Mike ran a workshop on using the prototyping kit and git for
    non-designers.]
-   [Met with colleagues in other government departments on making
    design systems better.]
-   [Went to the cross-gov design meet-up in Birmingham.]
-   [Made an offer to two interns (who accepted!) and prepped for next
    years cohort.]
-   [More updates and research on our internal 'Centre of Excellence'
    website]

On Monday we had the user research and design meet up in Sheffield for a
change, which was most welcome (especially as someone who travels weekly
down to London). The Interaction Design team meeting was a sketching
workshop to generate ideas for search functionality on an internal
system. Our designers spend most of their week embedded on delivery
projects so it's a always a nice opportunity for us all to work
together, even on something small.

Tuesday was one of the best cross-gov design meet-ups that I've been to
(partially because I spent a large portion of the day with my good
friend --- and favourite Fin
ever --- [Tero](https://twitter.com/teropsv){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/teropsv" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"} from NHS Digital). All of the speakers had interesting
things to share, from colleagues from NHS talking about [improving how
patients can get free
prescriptions](https://twitter.com/LouiseDowne/status/894929136292122624){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://twitter.com/LouiseDowne/status/894929136292122624"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} to Gavin Elliot's brutally honest and
brave [talk on imposter
syndrome](http://www.gavinelliott.co.uk/talks/imposter-syndrome/){.markup--anchor

Like many people at the event, I recognised some parts of myself in his
talk and it prompted a lot of discussion afterwards. One thing I often
think about, in relation to my work life, is 'what actual difference
*do* *I* make?'. Getting things done in any organisation, but
particularly in government, is hard and I find that I can very easily
fall back into a pattern of reactive busy-ness --- by which I mean
spending a lot of time reacting to things rather than actually
progressing towards real goals. I also look back on my work and I
sometimes wonder if I really have made any material difference by my own
contribution --- could anyone have really done that? It's a hard thing
to judge but that's also why I wanted to start working in the open
more --- so that I can catch myself when I do the things that don't move
me closer to my goals.

Mike, and one of our researchers
[Amy](https://twitter.com/amy_everett_){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/amy_everett_"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, ran a workshop on using the prototyping
kit for non-designers. It seemed to strike a chord and was very well
attended. We'll be running more of these kinds of things in the near
future and plans are already underway for adding modules to the
programme. Once we've made some improvements based on feedback we'll
publish it all on github.

We also had the opportunity this week to work with colleagues in other
government departments on making design systems better. Aside from the
nerdy joy of discussing this subject in depth with a bunch of very smart
people, I felt that everyone came at it with really good intentions to
make things better for the people designing and building services and
users.

Related to that, I have also started gauging interest in a meet-up with
other gov designers concerning design patterns for case-working systems.
Like other departments, the Home Office builds lots of systems like
this, and [whilst the best solution is often not building a case-working
system](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/20/building-internal-systems-v-providing-services/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/20/building-internal-systems-v-providing-services/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, there still are situations where one is
appropriate. If you're interested in finding out more let me know here:
