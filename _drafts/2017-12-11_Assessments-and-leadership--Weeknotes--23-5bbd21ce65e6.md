I worked from home on **Monday** morning as I was heading to London this
afternoon and it didn't make sense to make the trip into the office (I
live about 45 mins drive from Sheffield). I started the day with a few
catchups. I like starting the week this way, especially as I don't bump
into people I'm working with much being based up north --- think it's
very important to be deliberate about communications when working across
different offices.

I reviewed a designers blog post and then left before midday to catch my
train. Whilst on the train, I worked on my write up of the design sprint
the week before --- it's going to be a long one. I went over to GDS
first, to have a catchup with my mentor. We reviewed some the things I'd
been working on recently and looked ahead to the new year, which was
quite useful. I enjoy our chats, they help me think through things from
a different perspective.

Afterwards, I headed over to glorious Croydon where I was stopping
overnight for an early start service assessment in the morning (there's
no way I can get down from where I live for 9am in the morning). I has a
lovely chicken and noodle concoction from the Box Park there.

Most of **Tuesday** was spent on the panel for an internal Beta
assessment for an Immigration Enforcement project. After we had a post
assessment chat to collect our initial thoughts, I headed over to
another one of our offices (just up the road) to talk with Mike about
the Interaction Design Heath Checks we've been conducting recently. We
planning some of our next steps and collated all of our notes and
thoughts into one place, to make analysis easier.

As part of a civil service leadership course, I spent all of
**Wednesday** in a workshop in the middle of Sheffield. This was a
module that looked at, amongst other things, presence and types of
power. I admit, I was slightly apprehensive going into this. I only knew
one other person on the course and I'd missed the first day of the
workshop. I've also heard things from colleagues about civil service
training sometimes being too geared towards operational staff and the
'traditional' civil service. But I was pleasantly surprised by it. The
content was very relevant and interesting. The section about types of
power that we as leaders have over others and the types of power they
have over us was very informative. It had a lot of relevance to some of
the work I'm trying to do around influencing people --- it was a very
interesting perspective on relationships and authority.

I got loads of things done on **Thursday.** I spent the morning catching
up on emails from the previous few days. I don't like it when I don't
have a clear list of actionable things from my inbox, so I spent a bit
of time clawing through messages. I don't particularly get massive
volumes of email so it doesn't take ages, but it can take a while to
read through email threads to actually get to what I need to do.

Part of my day was spent doing admin type things. I ordered a phone and
set up accounts for my new boss Andrew, for when he starts in Jan.

It was also time for me to do my own performance evaluation for my goals
from the last three months. We're currently doing quarterly reviews, but
hopefully next year it should be twice a year. The software we use is
predictably terrible, but I think the process does have a lot of value.
I've found that these weeknotes really help in evidencing what I've
done, especially as I usually start each one with a bullet list of what
we've achieved.

At the end of the day, I had a great chat with Jack Collier from MOJ
about the work he's been doing around embedding user centred design in
policy. My interest was learning more about his tales of convincing
senior stakeholders of design value. He very kindly shared with me his
stories and a couple of blog posts he's written about his work.

On **Friday**, I spoke with Rob to follow up on the design sprint we had
last week. The team had since done some more research and presented the
work at a cross government data event. Great to see more progress in a
short space of time.

In the afternoon I had a catchup with our graphic designer Sue about
more upcoming work.

I attended the weekly cross gov design system meet-up over hangouts. I
mentioned that our working group for the Home Office design system is
going to drop its regular fortnightly meeting. We all seem to struggle
to attend and now that it's quite mature we all tend to have discussions
on slack anyway. The design system is a regular agenda item now for our
team meeting and it's quite an active topic of discussion.

More next week.
