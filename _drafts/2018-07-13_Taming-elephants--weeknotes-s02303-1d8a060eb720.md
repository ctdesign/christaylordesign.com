Apologies, this is a delayed weeknote as I didn't get a chance to hit
publish last week owing to a bit of a rush before going on a short
break. So it's a bumper edition instead!

It's been a very full-on fortnight but overall I have felt much more
productive than I have in a while.

I think this is partly because I feel slightly more in control of my
work since my [last
weeknote](https://weeknot.es/analysis-and-hamilton-weeknotes-s02e02-35c720ddfc6f){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://weeknot.es/analysis-and-hamilton-weeknotes-s02e02-35c720ddfc6f"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. My new process of planning my week in
detail on a Monday in Trello and making sure that everything I'm doing
(including all meetings, calls and small tasks) is in my to-do list has
helped enormously.

I've also started labelling cards as done, instead of moving them over
to a done column. This really helps me at a quick glance have a better
overview of what I'm doing and a better sense of accomplishment.

### **Things that happened** 

#### **Started journey mapping** 

For the Improving Decision Making project I'm working (still a working
title) on we decided to visualise the data we have into a journey map,
to help us understand gaps in our knowledge and inform the kinds of
questions we wanted to ask in the planned interviews.

During the session I wondered whether this would actually be a useful
thing. The problem here is that we're not visualising a traditional
service journey, we're using the technique to help understand decision
making processes.

But in the end I think its been very helpful. The actual process of
doing this as a team and the discussions we had helped us share more
knoweldge and teased out some clarity around things we thought we knew.

**Sometimes the doing is more important than the output.**

We've also been joined by another designer who is really helping
challenge some of our assumptions about the work which will be help make
it better and hopefully more effective.

#### **Started discussions around running another Sheffield design meetup** 

I met with my good chum
[James](https://twitter.com/JamesCapiche){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/JamesCapiche"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, who's over at DWP in Sheffield at the
moment. He messaged me recently keen to run a gov meetup in Sheffield
and wanted to chat to me about planning and ideas.

We had a good catchup and some interesting ideas to try and make it
relevant to people working in Gov in Sheffield.

More soon about this!

#### **I did a Show and Tell at MOJ Sheffield** 

A few weeks ago we did a joint show and tell in London with [Jack
Collier's](https://medium.com/@jackcollier?source=user_popover){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://medium.com/@jackcollier?source=user_popover"
target="_blank"} policy design team which was awesome. As I'm normally
based in Sheffield, we thought we'd head over to do a similar, shorter
show and tell with the MOJ Sheffield Digital Hub, based a short walk
from my office.

They have a great system of hosting a weekly show and tell every
Wednesday afternoon that anyone can book in a 10 min slot for via a
shared google spreadsheet.

It seemed to go well and generated lots of interesting chats afterwards.
Colleagues there seemed particularly interested in how our team are
using OKR's (Objective, Key Results) to create alignment across our
projects.

**Had a great design team meeting**

As a design community in the Home Office, we've been experimenting with
having separate, localised design meetings in the two main London
offices that our teams work from.

Previously we'd tried having one meeting in the same location every
couple of weeks and also tried a remote meeting via hangouts. These had
varying levels of success but we wanted to generate better discussions
when sharing work in progress and to raise issues openly, all of which
can be difficult when you're not in the same room. So we're trying this,
which seems to be working ok so far.

It was a really well attended session, which also had some non designers
in attendance which is always great to have.

anchor-type="2" user-id="587ad149ffc3" action-value="587ad149ffc3"
data-action="show-user-card" action-type="hover" target="_blank"} came
over to talk about the recent [launch of the cross gov design
system](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/22/introducing-the-gov-uk-design-system/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/22/introducing-the-gov-uk-design-system/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and what kinds of changes are in there.
We talked about how this impacts our work and how to use the [Home
Office design
system](https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/patterns"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} in conjunction with it.

#### Something I learned this week 

I'm finding the audiobook I'm listening to, *The Righteous Mind by
Johnathon Heidt*, incredibly interesting and have been gushing about it
to anyone foolish enough to sit next to me.

<figure id="f639" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<img
src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*e1nd_z-4k-zGrB2w.jpg"
class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*e1nd_z-4k-zGrB2w.jpg"
data-width="325" data-height="500" />
</figure>

It talks about a lot of very relevant things but one of the underlying
premises is how our minds are like a rider on an elephant and how much
of our emotional thinking is based on shared moral foundations, which
liberal rhetoric repeatedly fails to address.

Some choice quotes to whet your appetite:

> "Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second."

> "People bind themselves into political teams that share moral
> narratives. Once they accept a particular narrative, they become blind
> to alternative moral worlds"

> "The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant, and the rider's job
> is to serve the elephant."

There's [a nice summary of the elephant and rider
metaphor](http://sourcesofinsight.com/the-elephant-and-the-rider/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://sourcesofinsight.com/the-elephant-and-the-rider/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} on a summary of a related book (which
I've also bought) *Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard.*

The Righteous Mind is relevant in particular for those of a more liberal
persuasion who believe they're open minded but also think that
conservatively inclined people are misinformed or uneducated.

Now I just need to figure out how to apply this theory into my work.

#### Other stuff 

I went to Wimbledon! It was very hot.

My wife is a huge Tennis fan so combining her love of the sport and my
enjoyment of sitting outside sipping wine proved to be a rather
enjoyable day.

Queuing up for a couple of hours to buy a resale ticket meant we were
also able to see a good chunk of Nadal's match before we absconded to
watch the England semi-final.

I also managed to recruit another weeknoter! My rather splendid
colleague [Alex Gadsby](https://medium.com/u/642c18cbfe8a){.markup--user

get a bonus for recruiting more followers? ;)
