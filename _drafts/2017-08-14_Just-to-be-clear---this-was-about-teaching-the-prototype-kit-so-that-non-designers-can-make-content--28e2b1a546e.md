Just to be clear --- this was about teaching the prototype kit so that
non-designers can make content changes or try out hypothesise.

We also often publish the iterations and notes from the testing on the
homepage of the prototype, in order to illustrate the changes. I'm on
the cross gov slack --- get in touch with me there and I'll be able to
share some examples if you like.

We'll be publishing our training materials soon, and you would be
welcome to come to a future session/
