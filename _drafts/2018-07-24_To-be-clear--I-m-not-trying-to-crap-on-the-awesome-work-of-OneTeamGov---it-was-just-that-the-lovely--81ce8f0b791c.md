To be clear, I'm not trying to crap on the awesome work of
OneTeamGov --- it was just that the lovely outpouring of positivity last
week, coupled with a few other things I've been wondering for a while
prompted me to write some of these thoughts down. I do believe that
movements like OneTeamGov and others are great and are trying some
really good practical things.

I'm just thinking about the overall impression that these things coupled
with the generally positive blog posts (some of which I think are
starting to sniff of marketing) gives of what its like to work in
government.

Everyone in gov talks about the realities all the time when we're
together, but we're still restraining ourselves publicly I think.
