I've struggled to find time for weeknotes recently, so this is a bumper
edition of the last two weeks. I've spent *a lot* of time toing and
froing from home to London. Going to try and limit my travel over the
next few weeks to give me a break.

Typically, I start my weeknotes on a Friday afternoon but recently
Friday's have become a, kind of, clearing day for all of the small jobs
that accumulate, so that I can maximise the time I'm spending with
people down in London the rest of the week. I'm going to try and work on
weeknotes in small chunks in the future so it doesn't feel like such a
burden.

### Things that happened over the last two weeks 

#### Reviewing how we prioritise projects 

We're pretty busy in the Police Digital Service, with our time split
over projects we're directly funded to deliver and supporting existing
technology programmes in Home Office policing.

We frequently get requests to help out on new projects and we realised
that we needed to address how we evaluate and prioritise this work
against our own vision and objectives.

So as part of the Decision Making project I'm on, we're looking at
making clear project brief templates and a scoring matrix to help us
prioritise things with some semblance of a process.

It's one of those things that takes a while to set-up but, once in
place, will be easier to maintain.

#### A talk about how to change things 

A last minute change at our fortnightly design team meeting gave me the
opportunity to hastily put together a talk on two books that I've been
bending everyones ear about --- [The Righteous
Mind](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0076O2VMI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0076O2VMI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and
[Switch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B005TKD512/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B005TKD512/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

I think they're incredibly relevant to the kind of large scale change we
need to facilitate in order to enable digital projects to succeed. As
I've previously mentioned, The Righteous Mind gives insight into how our
brains work and *Switch* builds on that work by giving a practical
framework for making changes.

#### Lots of prototyping and planning 

I've spend a decent amount of time continuing to prototype on one of my
projects, which I've been really enjoying.

I've been focussing on search and figuring out the best way to display
results with the right level of detail. Using the new [GOV.UK Design
System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} coupled with the excellent [Home Office
Design
System](https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} (thank you [Michael
Owen](https://medium.com/u/587ad149ffc3){.markup--user .markup--p-user
data-href="https://medium.com/u/587ad149ffc3" anchor-type="2"
user-id="587ad149ffc3" action-value="587ad149ffc3"
data-action="show-user-card" action-type="hover" target="_blank"}) has
been a joy to design with. We really are spoiled in government, with so
many well thought out and considered resources --- it means I can spend
much more time having good discussion with the team and figure out some
of the more difficult issues.

Our team spent a couple of days last week in programme increment
planning sessions, which were useful to understand the upcoming pipeline
of work. There's a lot of changes happening in the programme at the
moment and it's hard to stay up to date with everything and it seems
even taking this kind of approach means key information easily slips
through the cracks. I think it's important on large projects with
multiple teams to keep having conversations with each other during
delivery and build in time to stay up to date on the wider programme.

### Non work stuff 

[I like to draw in my spare
tim](http://christaylor.tumblr.com/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="http://christaylor.tumblr.com/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}e but feel like I've not really made any improvements in
my techniques for ages. I think because I've been exclusively drawing
with my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil it's limiting how much I'm developing
so I'm planning to haul out my paper and pencil tin. Although using the
Pro is much more convenient when I'm slumped on the sofa with my wife,
half-watching reruns of ER.

I watched Infinity Wars again at the weekend which is even better on
repeat viewing. We finished Luke Cage on Netflix as well which overall I
enjoyed but I do think the middle was a bit drawn out, with far too much
time spent on the motivations of characters that I didn't really care
about.

I've been excitedly tinkering with an incredibly nerdy idea for making a
game. I've even done a bit of concept art which I guess also doubles as
a type of prototyping as it helped me figure out how some of it would
work and have written out a rough design document. I'm now beginning to
prototype some of the key concepts to see if I've even got the technical
capability to do this (I'm googling a lot) and, more importantly,
whether it's actually fun.

I sort of lost interest in [my last
idea](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzQ8I7iJrvFoutB--k5ZPCwlngvvotzIR){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzQ8I7iJrvFoutB--k5ZPCwlngvvotzIR"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} (which weirdly was much simpler)
although I'll probably return to it at some point. Here's an early
prototype of that one:
