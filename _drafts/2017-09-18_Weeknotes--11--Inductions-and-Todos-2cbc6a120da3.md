Some things we did this week:

-   [Met with our new graphic designer]
-   [Mike revamped the code and organisation behind our design
    system]
-   [Did a talk at a Product Manager community meet-up]
-   [Planned and prepped for the career day next week]

I was scheduled to head down to London on **Monday** but a meeting I had
planned got cancelled, which also saved me having to go overnight. I
spent most of the day on various calls, admin stuff and preparing things
for my now one day in London tomorrow.

**Tuesday** was spent all day in one of our offices in Croydon where I
met our new graphic designer, Sue, and went through a load of induction
things with her. It's the first time we've had a dedicated graphic
designer and a consistent stream of work has already started trickling
through. We have been using a Trello board (modified from a version GDS
published a while ago) to list everything new starters need to complete
in the first few weeks, which has proven to work pretty well. Inductions
are one of those things that seem to vary quite wildly in our
department, but we are starting to get better at this.

I was back in Sheffield on **Wednesday** where I did a talk on
Interaction Design at a Product Management community meet-up. I've been
trying to go around a few of the professional communities in the Home
Office to talk about what the role of an interaction designer on a
delivery team is, how they should be used in alphas to try lots of
different ideas and a bit about user-centred design. It was also an
opportunity to give everyone an idea of some of the things that we in
the centre of excellence can help with.

I also spent a bit of time with Katy to plan the update that we will
give at the first public facing cross-gov design meet-up, on Monday at
the Design Museum.

I worked from home on **Thursday**. I find that this really helps me
whenever I have either writing or lots of small jobs to get done --- as
there are fewer distractions. I had a call with GDS to ask some
questions about the careers day next week, which myself, Mike and Eliot
will be helping out at. This should hopefully be a fun day, so I'm quite
looking forward to it.

**Fridays** have started getting busier for me recently --- I seem to
have much more regular meetings than I use to. I spent part of the
morning re-doing how I manage my todo list. Before, I had a Trello board
with columns for:

-   [Backlog]
-   [This weeks most important things]
-   [Todays most important things]
-   [Someday/maybe]
-   [Done]

But I've been finding that I don't get in the habit of reviewing things
as frequently as I should, I don't prioritise things well for the week
and I don't sometimes dump everything in here.

So I've gone a bit more *Getting Things Done* and now have:

-   [Inbox --- where anything I think I should do gets dumped, processed
    daily into next actions or someday/maybe or just dealt with if it
    only takes 2 minutes]
-   [Next Actions --- A prioritised list of next actions. If it's more
    than one thing or a project, I will also create an item in the
    Projects column and use Trello's new [related cards
    feature](https://blog.trello.com/related-cards-related-boards){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor
    data-href="https://blog.trello.com/related-cards-related-boards"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"} to attach the action card to the
    project cards so I can easily see everything associated with a
    project.]
-   [Projects]
-   [Someday/maybe]
-   [Done]

I'm also in the habit of making a log of what I've done at the end of
every work day (just as a text file in Notes). I've also found it
invaluable when doing weeknotes. This guide to Getting Things Done was a
useful refresher for me:
[https://hamberg.no/gtd/](https://hamberg.no/gtd/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://hamberg.no/gtd/" rel="noopener"
target="_blank"}

We also had our team meeting, where Mike talked a lot about some of the
recent changes to the design system. We've been trying to make it into a
resource that is a living thing, that is less centrally managed. We have
moved the [management of patterns and components to
github](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns/projects/1){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/home-office-digital-patterns/projects/1"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, instead of Trello (inspired by the work
that [HMRC have been doing in this
area](https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://github.com/hmrc/design-patterns"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}) --- we hope this will be more open and
collaborative.

I had a quick catchup with our graphic designer about how things have
been going with her first week and attended a weekly cross-government
design systems meeting.

I finished the day with a meeting to plan the agenda for the forthcoming
case-working meet up. We've got a good outline of the activities for the
day now so I need to write it up for next week and start harassing
people to contribute and help me with it. We also may need to limit the
number of people on the day as demand has exceeded the capacity of the
room.
