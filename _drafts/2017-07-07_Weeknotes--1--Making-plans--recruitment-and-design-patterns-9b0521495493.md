Hi, I'm [Chris](http://twitter.com/ctdesign). I'm the Interaction Design Lead in Home Office
Digital, Data and Technology. Along with my colleague (and cake
enthusiast) [Mike](https://twitter.com/1mikeowen), we support the delivery of digital
services within a central 'Centre of Excellence' for Product Design.

We know [design is best done in the
open](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, so we're trying an experiment with
writing
[weeknotes](https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes/home){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://productforthepeople.xyz/weeknotes/home"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} of what we've been up to as part of this
central team --- please let us know if you have any feedback.

We started the week with a planning session around [our
goals](https://homeofficegovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/chris_taylor_digital_homeoffice_gov_uk/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=0047f89eed61943e5acdf6fe075077e41&authkey=AQ0BW7jxOKHZapHsMwqYsiw){.markup--anchor

data-href="https://homeofficegovuk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/chris_taylor_digital_homeoffice_gov_uk/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=0047f89eed61943e5acdf6fe075077e41&authkey=AQ0BW7jxOKHZapHsMwqYsiw"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, aligned to the overall goals of the
central team. We've also set up [a public Trello
board](https://trello.com/b/OR5L8Vdt/pd-coe-interaction-design-tasks){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://trello.com/b/OR5L8Vdt/pd-coe-interaction-design-tasks"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} so we can manage our work around this.
We're hoping that applying openness to this will help us monitor our
progress and stay on track better.

I also began sifting applications for new roles that will sit in key
operational areas of the Home Office (Border Force, Immigration & Visas
etc). The intention is that they help lead design within that area and
manage the designers working on delivery teams. The quality of all the
applicants is, quite frankly, intimidating, but then I remembered the
advice of Ed Catmull from his book 'Creativity Inc':

> [*Hire people smarter than
> you*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2014/04/08/ed-catmull-what-you-can-learn-about-creativity-from-pixar/#5d8155e24222){.markup--anchor

We have also finished reviewing the 75 applications we received for
Interaction Design interns. We already have two brilliant interns so we
are excited to have the opportunity for another round. The next step is
interviewing applicants on the phone next week.

We've been working hard on our [Home Office design
patterns](https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://home-office-digital-patterns.herokuapp.com/"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} this week. One of our designers
[Chris](https://twitter.com/wildsquirrelhub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/wildsquirrelhub"
rel="noopener" target="_blank"} has been helping refactor the code and
we've added some new patterns for further testing. We also helped GDS
organise some research with us and MOJ on the alpha for the new GDS
Design Patterns. Michael spent some time this week at GDS's new offices
in Whitechapel discussing the latest research on these and further
ideas.

Some other things we've achieved this week:

-   [began planning a 'ways of working' workshop for our teams across
    design and research with our Head of Content Design,
    [Lynne](https://twitter.com/LynnRob){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor data-href="https://twitter.com/LynnRob"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"}]
-   [started working on a new iteration of the design of our central
    team site following a round of research]
-   [getting goals agreed for all our permanent staff, as part of our
    performance management process]

I've also been trying to gauge the level of interest in a government
interaction design meetup in Sheffield and have had some encouraging
responses already. If that might be of interest to you please sign up

More next week!
