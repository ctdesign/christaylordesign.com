Some things we achieved last week:

-   [Me and [Mike](https://medium.com/@1mikeowen){.markup--anchor
    .markup--li-anchor data-href="https://medium.com/@1mikeowen"
    target="_blank"} visited some of the designers on our passports
    projects]
-   [Finally ran the designing case-working systems meet-up]
-   [Interviewed more candidates for Interaction Designer
    vacancies]
-   [Mike arranged and booked a bunch of upcoming training in our
    Sheffield office]
-   [He went to ConCon and wrote new guidance for managing
    prototyping]
-   [He also added a new pattern to our design system]

**Monday** began with another trip down to London. Me and Mike had
planned to visit two of our passports teams, who had recently moved
office. We wanted to talk through with the designers on those projects
to see how things are going. The intent is to learn more about what the
state of interaction design is on our projects overall and figure out
where we, within our central team, can best support them. We have a
guide document that we've put together to help structure our discussion,
but they're really just extended informal chats. They went well and we
learned a lot. I'm planning to schedule more very soon.

In the afternoon I popped over to Aviation House to check out the room
that I had booked for the designing case-working systems event that I've
been organising over the last few weeks. I always like to check the room
beforehand, just to make sure there's no last minute issues and that the
space worked for the workshops in the afternoon. We had overbooked the
event slightly, knowing that around a third of people wouldn't show
up --- but I was still a bit anxious about people not coming (really
didn't want to waste anyone's time). I sorted out a few things in the
room and chatted with the lovely receptionists at Aviation House to make
sure everything was set for tomorrow.

All of **Tuesday** was spent at the case-working event. I got there
early to setup the projector (why is that always the most fiddly part?).
We'd tried to also book the room next door but were told, rather
abruptly, that it was booked (turned out later that it was in use by
just 1 guy for about an hour in the afternoon). I was really pleased
with the turnout --- around 43 people came and enough people brought
print-outs with them so that we could run the afternoon workshop. The
day started with show and tells from Land Registry, DIT and Home Office.
My colleague Ayesha also did a talk on how case-working systems fit into
service design and common language that can be used to describe the
parts of these systems.

The afternoon workshop on identifying common design patterns and
components went well, with lots of really good feedback and discussion
going on. Unfortunately we didn't have time for the second workshop that
I had planned, which was around categorising user journeys into
categories that would help us all share our work --- I'll maybe save
that for a future event.

I took **Wednesday** off sick as I'd been suffering from a bit of cold
the previous few days that suddenly hit me full force. Lots of cups of
tea, watching Shawshank Redemption and First Contact on the sofa seemed
to help.

Reluctantly dragging myself out of bed, I spent **Thursday** in one of
our Croydon offices interviewing our next round of Interaction Design
candidates. This was for our mid-level role. I managed to squeeze in
catching up with email and various things I'd put aside whilst planning
the case-working event as well.

**Friday** was spent in Sheffield. I caught up with our graphic designer
in the morning to discuss a few projects she's got on and figuring out
the best way to approach them. I spent a good hour in our terrible
expenses and HR system approving things --- things that should only take
about 5 minutes to do. I chatted with Hannah, our Digital Internship and
Junior Development Programme Lead, about some of the recent recruitment
and talked through some of our options. We also had our weekly cross-gov
Design Systems meeting where we talked a lot about the role of content
in the acceptance criteria for patterns and discussed how departmental
working groups around patterns work. Always look forward to this meeting
as we end up having really good, thoughtful discussions.

Next week I'm doing, you guessed it, more interviewing! Hopefully will
be able to talk soon about our new appointees.
