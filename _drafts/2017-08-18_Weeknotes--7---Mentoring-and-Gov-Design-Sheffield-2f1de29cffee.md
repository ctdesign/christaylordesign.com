Some things we achieved this week:

-   [Ran the first Gov Design Sheffield]
-   [Ran induction sessions with new designers and feedback session with
    interns]
-   [Mike organised and booked two more prototype kit training events
    and made improvements based on feedback]
-   [Mike and a small team worked on redeveloping the internal centre of
    excellent website]

I spent all of Monday in London (which is pretty typical for me). In the
morning I met with some new interaction designers working on one of our
Passports projects and ran an induction session. With so many teams
working across the country, it's really important to try and get
face-to-face time to chat and to share information about how we approach
design, community related activities and our design system.

In the afternoon I met with my newly minted mentor. We're going to
catch-up every month to help me work on some areas of my personal
development. It was also nice to visit GDS's new digs and we went
through a series of questions to help tease out the areas I want to work
on. We agreed that themes would probably emerge after a few sessions and
I liked that it was more of a structured, informal chat rather than a
rigorous civil service process. This isn't something I've tried before,
but I think I'm going to get a lot out of this. I think it's also
probably useful to have a mentor from outside the organisation you work
in, as you get the benefit of a different set of experiences and
perspective.

A big thing for me this week was Gov Design Sheffield finally happening.
From making some tentative enquires seven weeks ago (just as I started
writing these weeknotes) asking if a gov design meetup in Sheffield was
of interest to anyone, it seems to have come around really fast. From my
chats with the attendees and the speakers it seems to have been really
well received so far. I've never run anything like this before and I
learned a lot from it. It seems that there's enough interest in running
another one in the future. I did panic a bit when only around two thirds
of the booked attendees showed up, but the feedback questionnaire I sent
round seems to be really positive so far. I called in quite a few
favours from friends to be speakers and I was really pleased they also
enjoyed themselves. I'm going to write a separate blog post soon on how
I planned it, what worked for me and what I would do differently.

On Thursday I had an interesting chat with a small external team working
with one of the Home Office's arms length bodies. It's pretty common in
government to get external companies to deliver specific outcomes, but
it always surprises me that the people commissioning those projects
don't get myself and my colleagues involved earlier. We have a wealth of
experience on all kinds of services within the Digital, Data and
Technology section and I am part of a specific team that has been set up
to provide support, guidance and set standards across all of our
delivery. Our chat came about as they started engaging with our Service
Assessment team about their upcoming alpha assessment --- a common way
that we sometimes find out about projects. We know that we need to do
more work to make sure that other non-digital parts of the Home Office
know about us.

Mike has been continuing to do some excellent work on planning more
training sessions around git and the prototyping kit. They have been
really popular with researchers and content designers and I like that we
have the capability to scratch our own itch.

He's also been continuing to iterate on our internal centre Centre of
Excellence website. The purpose of it is to contain all of our standards
and guidance and act as a central place to clearly articulate all of the
things that we can offer from different professions. From the first few
rounds of user testing we learned that how we categorised things didn't
really match the mental model that our users had, so we've been trying a
different approach. We're also trying to balance the need to get
something up quickly (we're managing it with Github pages) and having
useful content. We think that this will mostly serve as a conversation
starter, but there's value in having one place where all the relevant
information is held for reference.

I've caught myself a few times this week using the word '*they*' in
reference to parts of government that frustrate me and I'm trying to
force myself to stop it. 'They' is potentially a really dangerous word
and it encourages a tribal mentality where you and everyone you like is
on one side and everyone else is on the other. I know that I don't
represent the views of all designers, so I'd hate for someone else to
assume that everyone is like me. I'm trying to be more specific about
how I talk about these things instead, but it's difficult to de-program
yourself.

tried it with one staff member --- I didn't use all of the questions but
I did send them round before the session. It helped generate more
conversation around self-reflection over the last month, so I'll be
using it again.

More next week!
