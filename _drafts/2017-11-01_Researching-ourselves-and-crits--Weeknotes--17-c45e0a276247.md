Some things we cleared off our todo list, last week:

-   [Finished the last round of interviews for our senior interaction
    design vacancy]
-   [Mike began building a prototype for a mock service for testing our
    design system guidance]
-   [We both did some research with designers on the state of
    interaction design in their projects]
-   [Took part in some GDS design systems user testing]
-   [Set-up our design crits]
-   [Went to NUX6 in Manchester]

**Monday** began with a meeting with user-centred design colleagues from
our central team. We get together once a week to inform each other about
what we're up to. It's enormously helpful to have a like-minded peer
group to support me when I'm not sure on the best course of action. It
often helps reassure me that what I thought might be the right thing,
usually is (I need to trust my instincts more).

Now that most of the recruitment I've been doing recently is over, I set
aside this afternoon to review the outputs from the case working meet-up
I organised a few weeks ago.

I wrote up all of the notes from the afternoon workshop, where we got
into small groups to look at what commonalities there are around
departmental case working systems. I always underestimate how long
writing up post-its takes. The next step for me is to write up the
components and patterns that we identified somewhere (probably on
dropbox paper) with example screenshots. As a community we can them
begin to flesh out these with research findings and better
documentation.

I spent **Tuesday** all day in one of our Croydon offices. The main
purpose was to talk to the designers on three of our delivery teams to
learn more about what the state of interaction design is on their
projects. I always enjoy nattering to the team about their work. Our
next steps are to visit the last few teams on our list and then we'll
get together to analyse the outputs.

We are experimenting with running design crits in each of three main
digital offices, one in Sheffield and two in London. Previously we've
tried to do all of this together as a team but it's been hard to get
everyone in a room. We were going to try a buddy system that [Maria

great suggestion by [Chris
Hanson](https://medium.com/@WildSquirrelHub){.markup--anchor
.markup--p-anchor data-href="https://medium.com/@WildSquirrelHub"
target="_blank"}, we've opted for this first. There is one designer in
each office who's job it is to organise and corral everyone
together --- seems to be working well so far.

I was back in Sheffield on **Wednesday**. Got loads of small-ish jobs
done --- I reviewed some training plans, fed back on a blog post. Both
me and Mike participated in some user research with GDS on the cross-gov
design system. I spent some time reviewing all of the questions and
tasks for a final round of interviewing tomorrow.

On **Thursday** morning we had the second interviews for senior
interaction designer. The format for this included a short, prepared
presentation and a, kind-of, role play task which I think worked pretty
well. The afternoon whizzed by with a 1--2--1 with a staff member and my
own 1--2--1. I also finally managed to send out the speaker slides to
the case working meet-up attendees, which I'd been meaning to do for
nearly two weeks. Sorry.

I spent **Friday** in Manchester for the N[UX6
conference](https://2017.nuxconf.uk/){.markup--anchor .markup--p-anchor
data-href="https://2017.nuxconf.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.
Its usually a well attended meet up and this year had a really great
line up (it's also a bargain). My particular highlights were:

-   [**Amber Case: Designing Calm Technology\
    **Amber did a very articulate talk on using the principles of calm
    technology to design experiences that aren't constantly demanding
    your attention and instead blend into your life better.]
-   [**Clara Gaggero Westaway: The importance if empathy in design
    thinking\
    **Clara shared some great case studies on some really interesting
    projects --- I particularly loved a concept for a [smartphone manual

    data-href="http://specialprojects.studio/project/out-of-the-box/"
    rel="noopener" target="_blank"} that physically guides you through
    everything you need to setup your phone.]
-   [**Craig Sullivan: How to not suck at AB testing and analytics\
    **Based on the title alone I wasn't expecting to draw much from this
    talk but it was the highlight of the day. Part comedy routine, Craig
    had the audience in stitches as he talked about the absurdity of how
    we commonly approach testing and analytics. His slides were packed
    with lots of useful information and links to articles --- he's
    thankfully [shared them on
